Automated Testing
Code Validation
The W3C Markup Validator service was used to validate the HTML and CSS code used. The PEP8 Python Validator was used to validate the Pythoncode used. The JSHint JavaScript Validator was used to validate the JavaScript code used.

HTML Pages

I informed my mentor that my personal tutor had informed me that it was to validate a large batch of files with the website validator tool.  As this was the best practise in industry when working on large batches of files.  I showed the validator results from this website to my mentor and he said this would be good to do the validation like this.

-  [The Website Validator was used to check all of the HTML](https://datayze.com/site-validator?domain=https%3A%2F%2Fsupershop-2022.herokuapp.com%2F&parameters=&exclude=)

- The same test was carried out on the 10th of February 2023 and the result was the same as the original when retested.


My mentor informed me that the HTML could also be validated from the view page source of the live site. I copied and pasted the code from there and put it into W3C Markup Validation service. I informed my mentor that when I did a html validator test on my base.html it had errors and when I did a test on the view page source from the website that the html passed in the w3c validator.  My mentor explained that the validator passes from the view page source however it will not pass from the base.html site because that file uses jinja which is to do with django and python.  My mentor showed me on the jinja website and also told me to include this in my testing.md.

Python Files

I tried to use pep8 online and got these pages below. I informed my mentor and showed him in my mentoring session that pep8 online was not available and we tried a few others.  I explained that my personal tutor had informed me to install pep8 and use it on the terminal to check the python files and screenshots were taken when errors had been amended. My mentor said that this was a good way to do this.


-  [Screenshot of pep8 online](media/pep8.png)

-  [Link to Pep8 online](http://pep8online.com/)


My personal tutor informed that the best thing to do with the python validation testing was to do it in the terminal for larger files.  He explained that the pep8 install would check all the files. The following files were checked and any errors were corrected.

I cannot get the display on website action to appear in that box

that is what I did on the admin.py
Gemma profile
Thanks, Sunny! I'll take a look :)
Thank you Gemma
Gemma profile

Gemma profile
Ok Sunny, which changes are those? :)

sorry to bother you with this gemma
Martin told me add those lines of code yesterday and I was not sure if it was correct
