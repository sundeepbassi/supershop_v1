# Project Overview

## Introduction

Bubba the Supershop for dog products was inpired by a petblog that was created for a friend Shanti.  Shantis devotion and care for animal welfare and her pet dog amazed me and after doing the petblog we thought about how Shantis experience in purchasing products for her pet dog were the next step in sharing her experince of caring about her pet dog.  Shanti had a wealth of experience in pet care and when we first discussed this e-commerce website Shanti was able to give an extensive list of products that could be considered for selling.
It was Shanti's experience in owning a dog for the first time that made us realise that there will be people who will be considering the idea of owning a dog for the first or who already have a dog and want to be able to purchase dog products from someone who has good experince in dog ownership.

In her own words Shanti said "life is better with a dog"

## Evolving The name of the company to Pawpals 

## Pawpals

During the design and implementation process of this project, Shanti decided that she would like to call the company PawPals a dog's best friend.  The logo of the Paw inspired Moke and Shanti to have an emotional response of how dog's were best friends of humans and the Pawpals would be the best friends for dogs. This process happened during a design meeting with Shanti and Mike in their kitchen and both of them felt very inspired to rename the title of the company with its motto.  They felt the love for dogs gave them an insight into what would be appealing on this website for dog lovers.

After considering this idea for Pawpals I checked on the internet to see if the name was already in use, and we found that it was being used.

[Search for Pawpals on the web ](https://pawpalsshop.com/)


What I like about this project is that the ideas are being produced organically and Shanti and Mike have shown what is important to be a dog owner and what fellow dog owners may expect from an e-commerce website. 

The aim is to:

- To promote good dog and animal welfare.

- To grow a sense of community for dog lovers.

- To allow good quality products to be sold.

We considered the social customer demographic for this E-Commerce site.

Who is the customer?

- People who are new to dog owning and this is their first pet.

- Existing dog owners

- People interested in rescuing dogs from shelters.

- People who foster dogs.

- People of various ages.

- People that have a passion for dogs.

What will they buy?

- Dog Accessories
 - collars
 - Harnesseses
 - Leads

- Dog Food

How will they pay?

- They will pay online on the site through Stripe.

- The Supershop for dog products is a business to customer B2C website as products will be on sale for individuals to purchase for their dogs.

What is being sold? Deliverables

- Dog Products will be sold to customers with product details. As there will be a name for each product, a price of that product, an image of that product, a description of that particular - - product for the customer to see.

How is the payment made?

- The payment will be made as a single payment as the customer is paying for products that are displayed on the website. This will not be a subscription payment site.

With the Code Institute module on E-commerce Applicationn types and the article by BigCommerce that we decided that the business to customer model was right for this company to develop and grow on the web.

User Testing

## Skeleton

## Wireframes

- Both Shanti and I went through a number of wireframes to see how the site could be designed to her liking.

- The paper wireframe below was done as a way to map out to see how the web page would look like and it was a rough sketch for the next lot of wireframes.

- As Shanti is an artist we found that using paper sketches and using Balsamiq helped with the design of the wireframes.  

- [Balsamiq Website](https://balsamiq.com/)

- In the wireframe below we considered implementing the following:

- Main heading Bubba The Supershop For Dog Products

- The search bar.

- A shopping bag.

- A user profile.

- The main navigation bar.

- Social media links.

The aim was to have these implemented consistently throughout the website so that the user would be able to access any of the functions.

- Whislt doing the design process with Shanti, Shanti had an inspiration to incorporate a dog paw logo on the Website.

## SEO Reflection, Research and Implementation

Market research

On the 22nd of August I conducted some market research with some friends.  Shanti is a lover of animals amd has a pet dog amd I asked her if she was shopping on the internet what products would she like to buy for her pet.  Shanti gave me a very comprehensive list of products that she would look for. We imagined how Shanti would shop on line and what products would appeal to her and how the process of shopping online would make her feel.

Accessories would include glow in the dark collars, rope leads, harnesses, muzels, pet bowls. 

Grooming and bathing accessories would include nail clippers, pet toothpaste and brush, grooming brushes, conditioner, dog shampoo, 

clothing raincoats, winter coats, 


SEO Reflections

This reflective process was very important in the research of this project and website as it enabled one to take into consideration the needs of the users and discussing this with Shanti enabled one to clearly understand the needs of a dog owner and what they would would need and expect from an E-Cpmmerce website for dog lovers.  Originally the idea was to include many pet products for various types of pets but it became evident through Shanti's imput of focusing on dog products would be aiming for a specific market.

In our last video, we walked through a basic process for keyword research. In this unit we’re going to challenge you to use that same process to plan some possible keywords for a project of your own.

Your challenge is to walk through these steps we went through in the previous video. Come up with a selection of keywords you think would be important to customers for your chosen business.

Choose a business idea to do your keyword research for.

Dog products 

Your own project idea (possibly for your final project)

The idea was to create an E-Commerce website for dog products.

Keyword research steps

Brainstorm your general topics

On the 22nd of August I conducted some market research with Shanti who is the inspiration for this E-Commerce website as it was her passion for dogs and animals that was amazing.  Shanti is a lover of animals amd has a pet dog amd I asked her if she was shopping on the internet what products would she like to buy for her pet.  Shanti gave me a very comprehensive list of products that she would look for. We imagined how Shanti would shop on line and what products would appeal to her and how the process of shopping online would make her feel.

Accessories would include glow in the dark collars, rope leads, harnesses, muzels, pet bowls. 

Grooming and bathing accessories would include nail clippers, pet toothpaste and brush, grooming brushes, conditioner, dog shampoo, 

clothing raincoats, winter coats, 


Brain dump possible keywords for each of the general topics

The brain dump of ideas shortlisted 3 possible general ideas with subcategories.

Dog Accesssories would include the following:

- Collars

- Harnesses

- Leads

- Toys

Dog Clothes would include the following:

- Jackets

- Scarves/Bandanas

- Fancy Dress

Dog Food would include the following:

- Tinned 

- Biscuits

- Nutrition

Research your brain dump of ideas in Google Search

The general topics have been listed below with the highest ranking this also took into consideration what potential customers will be looking for to purchase.

Ensure you have a selection of short and long-tail keywords

Short-tail keywords

- Dog Products

[Google search for Dog Products 1](media/dp12022-09-06%20(1).png)

[Google search for Dog Products 2](media/dp22022-09-06%20(2).png)

[Google search for Dog Products 3](media/dp32022-09-06%20(3).png)

- Dog Harnesses

- Dog Leads

- Dog Jackets

- Dog Scarves/Bandanas

Long-tail Keywords

[Google search for The best nutrition for dogs? 1](media/bnfdgs12022-09-06%20(7).png)

[Google search for The best nutrition for dogs? 2](media/tbnfdgs22022-09-06%20(8).png)



- What tinned foods do dogs like?

- What are the best bicuits to give you dog?

- What toys do dogs like to play with?



Assess your choices for relevance and authoritativeness, and dig into the data available on keyword volume and competition using wordtracker.com

I found that dog products was a good keyword for relevance and authoritativeness.

The dog products keyword was inputted into wordtracker.com and the results can be seen below in the screenshots.

[Google search for the keyword dog products 1](media/wt12022-09-06%20(9).png)

[Google search for the keyword dog products 2](media/wt22022-09-06%20(10).png)

[Google search for the keyword dog products 3](media/wt32022-09-06%20(11).png)


From this list I revised the keywords from the brain storm and brain dump and incorporated the following keywords for the project,

dogfood

dog collars

dog harness

dog toys

best dog foods

dog clothes





Tips


Document your process.
If you’re planning for your final project, keep this documentation for your README
By the end of this exercise you should have between 10 and 20 keywords, which should be a mix of short-tail keywords and long-tail phrases.

Note
Keyword research is not an exact science. The volume and popularity of keywords constantly shifts. This means that deciding on keywords for a project is just the beginning of a journey, and marketing departments for e-commerce businesses have to continuously analyse and adjust them.



Content Challenge
 Bookmark this page
Content Challenge
In our last video, we talked about what things to consider including in your web page content to ensure it’s deemed a high quality search result.

In this unit we’re going to challenge you to use what you have learned and plan a single web page of your own.

Using the web application idea you chose for the keywords challenge, either:
Your own project idea (possibly for your final project)

Choose one important page from your chosen application. This might be the home page, a single product or service page or another important page in the application. Choose a page that you hope users would first land on when visiting your website.

- The page chosen is the landing page for customers as this includes the main navigation that can be used to access other areas of the site.

Questions to ask yourself:

What do your users need?

- My users need dog products to purchase. They will have the opportunity to sign up as users. 

What information and features can you provide to meet those needs?

- The ihformation provided to the users will be various dog products that they can purchase from the categories listed.

- There will be a feature to register and log in to the shop as a user.

How can you make the information easy to understand?

- The information will be broken down into various categories of dog products and from there the user will be taken to a specific category and the user will be able to view individual products for sale with the rating and the price.

How can you demonstrate expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness in your content?

- The contect will display a description about each product and it will give valauable information to the user about the product.

Would there be other pages within your own site you could link to from your chosen page?

- There will be a link to a blog about pets that will help the user know that this is a genuine site about dogs.

- There will be a link to a facebook page and a newsletter.

Are there opportunities to link back to external websites that already rank highly on Google?

How can you help users discover other relevant parts of your web application?

Tips
Research other sites that already meet the needs your users have, find examples of how they accomplish that.
Use the keyword list you created in the Keyword challenge to help prompt further ideas
Document your process. If you’re planning for your final project, keep this documentation for your README.
Give yourself around 10 to 15 mins to work on this.

By the end of this exercise you should have a list of things to include on your chosen web page that will be valuable to your user, and therefore improve its search engine ranking. Remember, if you’re using this exercise to plan for your final project, keep this documentation for your README.



SEO Keywords

- As the dog products keywords was very popular the title of the e-commerce shop was changed from The supershop for doggy things to the supershop for dog products, so as to optimise the search engine optimisation.

- The main navigation headings were changed to: 

- All Dog Products

- Dog Accessories

- Dog Food 

- Dog Clothes

The above  were changed as a result of doing the keyword research in google and and wordtracker.com. This was also done with the search engine module in the code institute module.


The SEO Implementations in HTML and the alt tags still need to be done,

and Other SEO Implementations

and Content is King

Web Marketing
Marketing Types Challenge
In our last videos, we explained some of the pros and cons of each marketing type, and we talked about which businesses they suit.

In this unit we’re going to challenge you to use what you have learned and plan which marketing types to use for an ecommerce business.

Using the ecommerce business idea you chose for the keywords and content challenges:
Your own project idea (possibly for your final project)

Plan out which marketing types you think would work best for your chosen business. Jot down which ones you think the business would benefit from using, and why.

Questions to ask yourself

Who are your users?

- My users are dog lovers who want to purchase dog products.

Which online platforms would you find lots of your users?

- The online platforms where I would find lots of users would be facebook, youtube, instagram, tiktok and twitter.

Would your users use social media? If yes, which platforms do you think you would find them on?

- Yes my users would use social media and the platforms that I would find them on are facebook, youtube, instagram, tiktok and twitter.

What do your users need? Could you meet that need with useful content? If yes, how could you best deliver that content to them?

Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?

- At the moment the business would not run sales and discounts would need to be looked into once we were better establishe.

What are the goals of your business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?

- The marketing strategies tha were considered for the supper shop were:

- Search Engine Optimization.

- Content marketing and Social Media marketing,

- I decided to rule out email marketing and paid advertising, as this was a start up and we wanted to focus on the social marketing as a way to promote the products on various platforms.


Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low cost options to market itself?

- As this is a start up E-Commerce site there would not be a budget for advertising therefore it would need to work with free and low cost options to market itself.


The article below considered the social customer demographic for for purchasing dog products online.

 "In the pet food and supplies segment, social media had the biggest purchase influence on Generation Z and Millennials. In a survey conducted in October 2021 in the United Kingdom, 26 percent of Millennials reported being influenced by social media when purchasing pet food and supplies. In contrast, that figure stood at only two percent for Baby Boomers."

[Google search for Dog Products on Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1291512/social-media-influence-on-pet-supplies-purchases-by-generation-uk/)

Tips
Research other ecommerce businesses that sell similar products or services to your idea. What marketing practices do they employ? Which ones appear to be working best?

[Google search for Allivet smaller storer](https://www.allivet.com/)

[Google search for dog.com ](https://www.dog.com/)

We considered the content marketing process as quite useful as the website was giving an emotional response to friends that saw the website. Shanti also had very good experience of owning a dog and it was her insight into dog care that was both inspirational and interesting.  Shanti could empathise with fellow dog lovers and knew that good products were important to dog lovers.

Shanti was interested in the organic social media marketing as she used these platforms to connect with family, friends, colleagues and the community.  These platforms would be useful for Shanti to sell her Dog Products.

As Shanti also has an existing blog for pets the supershop for dogs would be considered as an extension of how good quality dog products could be sold to potential customer.

Shanti also dog sits and walks dogs for friends and again it was this social aspect of her involvement with dogs and animals that promoted the idea of having the supershop for dogs promoted on the organic social media marketing contents.

Both Shanti and I discussed the idea of email marketing and paid marketing and Shanti felt that she did not want to come across as forceful in selling her products but wanted the customers to trust the website and the products being sold naturally.

SEO Research and Implementation

SEO Research


Keyword Research
Keywords Challenge
In our last video, we walked through a basic process for keyword research. In this unit we’re going to challenge you to use that same process to plan some possible keywords for a project of your own.

Your challenge is to walk through these steps we went through in the previous video. Come up with a selection of keywords you think would be important to customers for your chosen business.

Choose a business idea to do your keyword research for.
Your own project idea (possibly for your final project)


Keyword research steps

1) Brainstorm your general topics
Brain dump possible keywords for each of the general topics
Research your brain dump of ideas in Google Search
Ensure you have a selection of short and long-tail keywords
Assess your choices for relevance and authoritativeness, and dig into the data available on keyword volume and competition using wordtracker.com
Tips
Document your process.
If you’re planning for your final project, keep this documentation for your README
By the end of this exercise you should have between 10 and 20 keywords, which should be a mix of short-tail keywords and long-tail phrases.

Note
Keyword research is not an exact science. The volume and popularity of keywords constantly shifts. This means that deciding on keywords for a project is just the beginning of a journey, and marketing departments for e-commerce businesses have to continuously analyse and adjust them.


SEO Keywords

Web Marketingg


Marketing Types Challenge
In our last videos, we explained some of the pros and cons of each marketing type, and we talked about which businesses they suit.

In this unit we’re going to challenge you to use what you have learned and plan which marketing types to use for an ecommerce business.

Using the ecommerce business idea you chose for the keywords and content challenges:
Your own project idea (possibly for your final project)
A pizza restaurant, based in Dublin, that takes online orders for delivery.
Plan out which marketing types you think would work best for your chosen business. Jot down which ones you think the business would benefit from using, and why.

Questions to ask yourself
Who are your users?
Which online platforms would you find lots of your users?
Would your users use social media? If yes, which platforms do you think you would find them on?
What do your users need? Could you meet that need with useful content? If yes, how could you best deliver that content to them?
Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?
What are the goals of your business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?
Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low cost options to market itself?
Tips
Research other ecommerce businesses that sell similar products or services to your idea. What marketing practices do they employ? Which ones appear to be working best?
Document your process. If you are planning for your final project, keep this documentation for your README.
Give yourself around 10 to 15 mins to work on this. By the end of this exercise you should have a list of possible marketing strategies you could use for your chosen business. Remember, if you’re using this exercise to plan for your final project, keep this documentation for your README.

Content marketing

The content if this website aims to invoke an emotional response with customers that are passionate about dogs. The content has been created specifiaclly for dog lovers and only products for dogs are being sold on this site.  It was decided that a generic site for a variety of pets may take the focus away from dogs. The idea was for dog lovers to view products that they needed for their dog of dogs. Shanti is a dog lover and she has a dog and she also house sits for other dog owners and walks dogs in her spare time her passion for dogs has enabled her to gain knowledge and understand about the needs of dogs and this has made her an expert in this field. Shanti showed an interest in sharing her love for animals by having a blog post created for her interest where she could share her interest and interact with other animal lovers.

Social Media marketing

Shanti already has a blog post for animal lovers so as to spread her passion about animals and caring for them.  Shanti wants to also promote her e-commerce site and products on social media and specifically Facebook.  Shanti realised that this was a good method to create awareness about animal welfare and also promote her e-commerce site.

Resolved Issues

During the implementation of the custom model for reviews I realised that putting it in a app was the best method for having this function work more effectively.

On the 21st of August I had to contact tutor support whether the dj_database_url and psycopg2-binary installations would be compatabile versions for the project.  The tutor support informed me that having the incorrect versions may cause errors amd guided me innstalling the correct versions into my requirements.txt file with the migrate command.



Hi tutors I am receiving this error in my terminal when I try to do a git push

Scott profile
Hi, Sunny 😀 You will have changes on your remote GitHub branch that you don't have in your workspace - that's where this particular issue comes from. If you're lucky, you'll just be able to run the git pull command and it will balance the two versions out. I expect it will moan at you when you try though. If that happens, there are some steps we can take to get around it, but let's try the git pull first
Good to hear from you Scott how are you doing buddy
do I just type git pull in my terminal


I typed git pull in my terminal and got this
Scott profile
I'm alright 😀 Yourself? That's what I was expecting it would come back with. In that case, let's try one of the options it gives you there:
git config pull.rebase false
That won't appear to do anything by itself, by try the git pull again afterwards and it may all be alright after that. Works about 7/10 times
Thanks Scott I am good mate I will give it a go
Hi Scott I tried that and it gave me this in the terminal and it seemed to have stalled

Scott profile
Ah, that's a good sign! It has opened a tab in your workspace to type a merge message. It gives you a default one that will be fine, so just close that tab and it will save and continue:


Hi Scott sorry I think I might have exited the merge to early by typing cntrl c

Scott profile
That has just made things more difficult
sorry Scott
Scott profile
You can try the git pull again, but I think it will moan at you
ok

I tried to a lot of times in the terminal and it keeps on giiving me this message
Scott profile
Try this:
git merge --abort
That should hopefully take us out of the merging state and then the previous commands should work again
thanks scoot I will give it a go

I think the merge has stopped in the terminal
after the command you sent me
Perfect!
Scott profile
Try the git pull again now - it should open that tab back up with the merge message

It has brought this up
Scott profile
Perfect, just close that tab with the X and it will save the merge message it has generated


Scott profile
Excellent, that has pulled correctly now 😀 You should be able to push again at this point!

Brilliant Scott I just did a git push it is working good Thankyou Buddy

You are a star and thank you for all of your kind support and help hope you have a peaceful evening

Deployment

Hi tutors,
I am doing the boutique ado Creating a Heroku App and on the top of the video there is this message. Important!
Error fix
If you get the error below during the steps to deployment:
django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL: role "somerandomletters" does not exist
Please run the following command in the terminal to fix it:
unset PGHOSTADDR
A note for creating your database if you didn't use fixtures
When you come to follow this process for your milestone project, you may not have used a fixtures file to populate your database like the instructor did.
If this is the case, manually re-creating your database when you come to deploy can take a considerable amount of time. Thankfully, there is a short process you can follow to download your local mysql database and then upload it to postgres:
Make sure your settings.py file is connected to your sqlite3 database
Use this command to backup your current database and load it into a db.json file:
./manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
Connect your settings.py file to your postgres database
Then use this command to load your data from the db.json file into postgres:
./manage.py loaddata db.json

Your database DATABASE_URL on supershop-2022 requires maintenance. During this period, your database will become read-only. Once maintenance has completed, your database credentials and hostname will have changed, but we will update your app's config variables accordingly to reflect the new database connection string.
This automated maintenance is a necessary part of our Hobby tier plans, Dev and Basic. Should you need more control over maintenance windows, a production database (Standard tier or higher) offers more control over database maintenance, as we are able to schedule them in advance and provide better tools for self-served maintenance.
We expect maintenance to last just a few moments depending on the size of your database. We will notify you when maintenance begins, and again once it's complete.

One final thing. Please share your code with us. 
If you are working on Gitpod, please set your workspace to shared, and send us the link to it. If you are working on a course challenge, please send the name of the challenge.

Thank you. We will get back to you as soon as possible. You can see how busy tutoring currently is on this page: https://code-institute-org.github.io/tutoring-info/status/
Note that if you have failed to sufficiently answer any of the above questions, tutors will have to re-ask you for the information, which will use up part of your weekly tutoring time allowance.
Hi Sunny, John here
I hope you are well
Looks like an email from Heroku about database maintenance
John profile
There's nothing wrong. Heroku need to run maintenance on their servers from time to time.
All that will happen is, your database credentials will rotate.

﻿What this means is that your database will have a new Postgres URI (DATABASE_URL)
Hi John good to hear from you hope you are well
Thank you, I am well :)
Your heroku app config vars will update automatically
John profile
You'll simply need to update your local DATABASE_URL with the new Postgres URI


Hi John I added the new link from Heroku
I added my products manually into my admin django and I tried to follow the dev tips on slack and was getting confused with it

John profile
You will fail the project if you push the code to the repo with this line exposed in settings.py

SORRY jOHN i DID NOT UNDERSTAND DO i UNCOMMENT IT
sorry my caps lock was on
would it be best to uncomment lines 133 to 138
John profile
That line there is your postgres URI string. It should be hidden, and never pushed to the Repo. But this is covered in the course materials.
Even there in the PDF that you are walking through, it is using the DATABASE_URL variable

I remember when I watched the video they told us to comment it out and then they put it back in
what would the best thing to do
John profile
They told you to comment it out for a short while, then they stored the variable in DATABASE_URL and used that instead, so that the variable would not be exposed.
Do you have an env.py file in your project?
I have had a look and I can not find one
John profile
Alright, so you should probably set that up.
For setting env vars locally, we recommend setting them like this:
Create a file named env.py in the root directory of your project. This is the file you will use to define your environment variables.
If you don't have one already, create a file named .gitignore  in the root directory of your project.
 Next we need to stop git from pushing this file to github, and so keep your environment variables secret. To do this, open your .gitignore  file add the following text to it: env.py 
At the top of your env.py  file, you need to import os so that you can set the environment variables in the operating system. Once you have added the line “import os” underneath you can assign your environment variables using the following syntax: 
os.environ["Variable Name Here"] = "Value of Variable Goes Here" 
Example: os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "ohsosecret" 
Then the following code imports this new env.py file where you need to use your environment variables. For example your app.py file for flask project or settings.py file for Django project. Add this under your other imports at the top of the file. 
import os
if os.path.exists("env.py"):
  import env 
The if statement here is so that the env.py file is only pulled when working on your code in your workspace, not when it is deployed on heroku. For deployment you can set your environment variables in the heroku dashboard in settings > config vars.
Now that your environment variables have been set in your env.py file, and the file has been imported into your project, you can use them as needed using the following syntax: 
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
﻿Make sure you save all your files before testing if it works.
how do i set up the env.py in the root directory

I have a gitignore file
sorry john it is confusing

i created my env.py file there

I put that info into the env.py file
John profile
Okay, follow the steps to declare your variables.
Hi john i am still confused wit the steps
John profile
Hey Sunny, unfortunately you need to follow the steps, step by step. Exactly as they are laid out there.
Your on the right path, but you need to put in your actual variables.
In this case DATABASE_URL, and then you need paste the value of the postgres URI where the value of the variable goes
os.environ["Variable Name Here"] = "Value of Variable Goes Here"
Example: os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "ohsosecret"
Then the following code imports this new env.py file where you need to use your environment variables. For example your app.py file for flask project or settings.py file for Django project. Add this under your other imports at the top of the file.
import os
if os.path.exists("env.py"):
  import env 
The if statement here is so that the env.py file is only pulled when working on your code in your workspace, not when it is deployed on heroku. For deployment you can set your environment variables in the heroku dashboard in settings > config vars.
Now that your environment variables have been set in your env.py file, and the file has been imported into your project, you can use them as needed using the following syntax:
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
﻿Make sure you save all your files before testing if it works.

I have managed to do that

This part is meant to be in settings.py

John profile
take it out of env.py and place it in settings.py, here's the instruction :)


I added it to settings file
John profile
Excellent, now go back to the DATABASES code in your settings.py and make sure it looks like this

Thanks John I will work on that and will get bgck to you once it is done, I appreciate your kindness and support it takes me time to understand the steps
John profile
You're welcome Sunny.
I'm actually due for my break now, but I'll set this conversation aside and leave notes for my fellow tutors.
You can simply reply to re-activate it and someone will be with you as soon as available
Thanks John have a good break 😄
John profile
Thanks Sunny 😀
Hi I have added the new line of coded in my settings,py file from line 138 to line 148 do I take out the oldcode from line 131 to 136
Ed profile
Hi Sunny, Ed here 👋
Hope you're well. Sorry for the delay we've got a few tutors off sick today. How are you getting on with John's suggestion?
Hi Ed good to hear from you, I am good thank you How are you doing, sorry to hear that some of the tutors are off sicj

I managed to do that Ed
Ed profile
I'm good thanks! Hopefully they will all be on the mend soon - it's the season for getting poorly!
I know I cannot believe we are in september
Ed profile
OK, so you shouldn't need the first DATABASES = .... part
You can remove lines 131-136
great
I managed to do that Ed
Ed profile
I'm just trying to load up your workspace, but from John's last message it sounds like you were trying to create an env.py to get your local server up and running. Are you now able to load your app through Gitpod?
https://sundeepbass-supershopv1-6tuyxyxoq9v.ws-eu64.gitpod.io/
John helped me to set up the env.py file
Ed profile
Awesome, and has that allowed you to load your site?
I am not sure on how to load it Ed the extra bank holiday has made my brain run slower
Haha, they'll do that :)
Just the regular old python3 manage.py runserver should get you going :)
Ed profile
Looking at your env.py, there will be a couple more environment variables you need to add. The most obviously missing one is SECRET_KEY

that was the message I got when I tried to open my server
Ed profile
OK, that means you need to apply your migrations. Just follow the advice it gives 👍
sorry Ed how do i set up a secret key in env.py
Ed profile
You already have one written in your settings.py, so you'll need to change that so that it's pointing to os.environ['SECRET_KEY']
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', '')
Then in your env.py:
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'my_superseCRETkey1497149014091470'
or whatever you want it to be :)
Thanks I will give it a go
Ed profile

You don't want to expose your secret key in your settings.py like this. Replace with what I posted above. That means it will get your SECRET_KEY from your environment, which is env.py in this case. In Heroku it will be your Heroku config vars.

Ed profile
Have another check of what I put in my last message Sunny:
one change in settings.py
one addition in env.py
thanks ed
i will have another go
Ed profile
👍
We make a variable in settings.py which points to the environment using the dictionary key 'SECRET_KEY'
We then make an entry in env.py using that dict key and give it the secret value.
If you're wanting to make use of these other environment variables in your LOCAL project, then you'll need to do the same thing. See how these three variables are set to the values it finds in your environment:

That will mean you need dictionary entries, and their values, for STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY AND STRIPE_WH_SECRET too.

Ed profile
In settings.py:
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', '')
This means, make a variable called 'SECRET_KEY' and get the value from the environment (env.py). If you can't find 'SECRET_KEY' in the environment, use a blank string.
In env.py:
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "some_secret_string"
This is what the SECRET_KEY variable in settings.py is pointing to. In effect, in settings.py your app will see:
SECRET_KEY = 'some_secret_string'
Except 'some_secret_string' is coming from a hidden file that only your app can see. This means noone else in the world can see your secret key.
The same applies to all secret things you want to do - just stick them in your environment and refer to the value found for that dictionary item.
Thanks Ed I will give it a go

OK fab! I need to head to lunch, Sunny so will pop you back in the queue for the next tutor to pick up with.
If you can let them know where you get to that would be very helpful. From what I can see your app is working locally, but you will need to understand what role the env.py (environment) is playing so that you can add any necessary keys here, and when you come to deploy your app. In your Heroku app, the 'Heroku config vars' act as your local environment, rather than env.py, so you'll need to make sure all the required keys and values are stored there too 👍
Thank you Ed for all of your kind support Have a good lunch buddy
Ed profile
Great, will do. You too Sunny! 👋
👍


Hi I followed the steps shown by Ed wanted to check if they are correct
Oisin profile
Hi Sunny, Oisin here 👋
﻿Yep that looks good. Just having a look through the chat now. What was the specific issue that you wanted to address in this conversation?
Hi oisin good to hear from you hope you are well I am trying start off the deployment process for Heroku and I have been following the devtips sheet from slack and I could not uderstand it and both John and Ed were helping me
I added my products manually in the Django Admin and we were told to follow a certain format for this
Oisin profile
Ok perfect, which part of the deployment process were you having trouble with?
https://code-institute-room.slack.com/files/UPDFEU62U/F02SZ5T16HG/transferring_database_data_from_sqlite_to_heroku_postgres.pdf?origin_team=T0L30B202&origin_channel=C01C4AU8ULA
I was working on that sheet and found it difficult to follow
Important!
Error fix
If you get the error below during the steps to deployment:
django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL: role "somerandomletters" does not exist
Please run the following command in the terminal to fix it:
unset PGHOSTADDR
A note for creating your database if you didn't use fixtures
When you come to follow this process for your milestone project, you may not have used a fixtures file to populate your database like the instructor did.
If this is the case, manually re-creating your database when you come to deploy can take a considerable amount of time. Thankfully, there is a short process you can follow to download your local mysql database and then upload it to postgres:
Make sure your settings.py file is connected to your sqlite3 database
Use this command to backup your current database and load it into a db.json file:
./manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
Connect your settings.py file to your postgres database
Then use this command to load your data from the db.json file into postgres:
./manage.py loaddata db.json
If you would like more information on this process along with a few handy tips, have a look at this DevTip on Slack.
That is the informaiton they gave us at the start of the video
Oisin profile
Ok, if you run your server in gitpod now, are your products there?

they are not displaying

it wont let me log into my admin now
Oisin profile
Ok, so your products are stored in the sqlite database. Do you want to transfer them to the heroku postgres database?
I added my products to django admin manually
Yes I think I have to transfer to the heroku postgres database
Oisin profile
Ok, you will need to comment out the DATABASE_URL variable in your env.py, so that your settings will use the sqlite database which contains your products.


is that what i do
Oisin profile
Ok perfect, make sure to save the file, then run your server to confirm that the products are there.
Hi Oisin the products are there
Oisin profile
Ok perfect now we're going to run this command to save your data to a json file:
﻿Make sure to type the command instead of copy/paste
python3 manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
i will have a go

Hi oisin I typed it in like that is tha tok
Yep that's perfect, you can hit enter
Oisin profile
That will create a db.json file containing your data

it gave me an error
I think there was a space before the second 'exclude'
Oisin profile
You can use the up arrow to go to a previous command and remove the space, then hit enter
ok
Make sure to remove the space before the second exclude
You can use the right and left arrows to move the cursor in the terminal
Oisin profile


Oisin profile
Make sure to type the command exactly as it is here:
﻿


is that correct Oisin
Oisin profile
Ok perfect, now you can uncomment the DATABASE_URL in your env.py, then save the file
I did that
Oisin profile
Ok now lets load the data into your postgres database:
﻿
python3 manage.py loaddata db.json

Oisin profile
I'm not sure if the previous commands ran correctly, do you mind if I try running them again?
Please oisin that will be good
do you want me to put them in the terminal
Oisin profile
I've run them so lets run your server now to confirm if the data has been transferred to your postgres database
do i do python3 manage.py runserver
yep exactly 🙂
Oisin profile
Looks like the products haven't been transferred, I'm going to try to transfer only data from specific apps ok?

thanklyou
Oisin profile
Ok, looks like that has transferred successfully 🙂
thankyou Oisin you are a star
Oisin profile
Glad to help! 🙂 Now you can continue with the rest of the deployment steps as outlined in the course materials.
Thank you Oisin I will follow the video now you have been a great help have a great day
😄
Oisin profile
You too! 😄
Help Oisin understand how they’re doing:
Tutoring at Code Institute profile
You rated the conversation 
Thanks for letting us know
The turors Oisin, Ed and John have all helped me today and made me understand how the env.py file works. They have been very supportive and empowered me to learn a lot with perserverance.
👍
😄
Oisin a big thank you to you and to Ed and John I am very grateful to you all
