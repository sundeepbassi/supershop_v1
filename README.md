# Project Overview

During this project I was unfortunately made homeless and it was the kindness of my family and friends and my Doctor and the student support team at the code institute that gave me the support that I needed to get through.  I learnt alot from this process and I was determined that I would not give up and carry on with the project to the best of my ability.

## Introduction

Bubba the Supershop for dog products was inpired by a petblog that was created for a friend Shanti.  Shantis devotion and care for animal welfare and her pet dog amazed me and after doing the petblog we thought about how Shantis experience in purchasing products for her pet dog were the next step in sharing her experience of caring about her pet dog.  Shanti had a wealth of experience in pet care and when we first discussed this e-commerce website Shanti was able to give an extensive list of products that could be considered for selling.

It was Shanti's experience in owning a dog for the first time that made us realise that there will be people who will be considering the idea of owning a dog for the first time or who already have a dog and want to be able to purchase dog products from someone who has good experince in dog ownership.

In her own words Shanti said 

"life is better with a dog"

## Evolving The name of the company to Pawpals 

## Pawpals

During the design and implementation process of this project, Shanti decided that she would like to call the company PawPals a dog's best friend.  The logo of the Paw inspired Mike and Shanti to have an emotional response of how dog's were best friends of humans and the Pawpals would be the best friends for dogs. This process happened during a design meeting with Shanti and Mike in their kitchen and both of them felt very inspired to rename the title of the company with its motto.  They felt the love for dogs gave them an insight into what would be appealing on this website for dog lovers.

After considering this idea for Pawpals I checked on the internet to see if the name was already in use, and we found that it was being used.

[Search for Pawpals on the web ](https://pawpalsshop.com/)

Shanti and Mike still liked the name pawpals and wanted to keep it whilst developing the site and were happy to reconsider changing it if they wanted to make the site an official company so as not to break any copyright infringements.




What I like about this project is that the ideas are being produced organically and Shanti and Mike have shown what is important to be a dog owner and what fellow dog owners may expect from an e-commerce website. 

The aim is to:

- To promote good dog and animal welfare.

- To grow a sense of community for dog lovers.

- To allow good quality products to be sold.


## E-commerce application types:

We considered the social customer demographic for this E-Commerce site.

Who is the customer?

- The business to customer model was identified as the best for this e-commerce site.
 
 - Dog product customers tend to be impulse buyers.

 - These customers make up their own choices about what to buy for their dogs.

 - They prefer a simple and effective method of payment, so as to buy impulsively.


- People who are new to dog owning and this is their first pet.

- Existing dog owners

- People interested in rescuing dogs from shelters.

- People who foster dogs.

- People of various ages.

- People that have a passion for dogs.

What will they buy?

- They will buy products for their dog/s.

- Dog Accessories
 - collars
 - Harnesseses
 - Leads
 - Toys

- Dog Food
 - Tinned
 - Biscuits
 - Nutrition

- Dog Clothes
 - Jackets
 - Scarves/Bandanas
 - Fancy Dress

How will they pay?

- As customers they will be buying products and the method used will be a single payment system. As the transaction is finished once the customer has made the single payment for the products.

- They will pay online on the site through Stripe.

- The Supershop for dog products is a business to customer B2C website as products will be on sale for individuals to purchase for their dogs.

What is being sold? Deliverables

- Dog Products will be sold to customers with product details. As there will be a name for each product, a price of that product, an image of that product, a description of that particular and a product for the customer to see.

How is the payment made?

- The payment will be made as a single payment as the customer is paying for products that are displayed on the website. This will not be a subscription payment site.

With the Code Institute module on E-commerce Applicationn types and the article by BigCommerce, we decided that the business to customer model was right for this company to develop and grow on the web.

## Project Future

- To continue to promote  the site for dog lovers and animal welfare.

- As this is a shop for dog lovers and we want to create a sense of community about dog ownership posting pictures of pet dogs by customers on a board would be good.

Future Features

In the future we would like to let each registered user be able to submit only one review.

I discussed incorporating the user story from below with my mentor and it we decided that this could be used for a future feature or I could use the method I had incorporated with the email confirmation for registering an account.  I decided because of time constraints I would do this as a future feature.

As a shopper I want to be able  to  receive an email confirmation after checking out so that I can keep the confirmation of what I have purchased for my records.

I also showed my mentor the information from stripe that email confirmations for payment receipts are not sent for test transactions.

## Develpoment Planes

We wanted a website that would appeal to dog lovers by products for their dogs and any related audience who had an interest in animal welfare. Shanti and Mike were the main inspirations for this site. They both gave me an insight as potential users about what the user stories could be or this site.  As dog lovers they gave me a wealth of knowledge about what dog products could be sold on the site.  I also checked out the following sites for further information.

[Whilst I was designing the site I came acress this online store that inspired me ](https://www.petshop.co.uk/)

[Search for Pawpals on the web ](https://pawpalsshop.com/)

[Pet Planet](https://www.petplanet.co.uk/d2/dog_products)

These sites gave me an idea about how the layout could be worked out for Pawpals and check on how the functionality worked on the sites and what features could work best.

## Strategy

- This was quite a unique site because both Mike and Shanti could both be site users and site owners.  Therefore their perspective was very relevant in developing the site.

- Both Mike and Shanti came from creative backgrounds and wanted the site to be as appealing as possible.

- Shanti is an artist and a teacher and her knowledge in art and colour matching would help the site to be more attractive.

- Both Mike and Shanti had a clear vision that the target audience aimed at for this site should be anyone who loves dogs.  

- The focus was for it to be for dog owners or potential new dog lovers.

- Any Age group could use this site.

- Their experience with owning a dog had helped them to connect with other dog owners.

- They had taken their dog to cafe nero a dog friendly cafe and they met other like minded dog owners.

  - Taking care of their dogs.

  - Talking about their experiences about their dogs.

  - Sharing funny or memorable stories about their dogs.

  - Talking about their dogs habits or behaviour.

  - Sharing information about dog products and dog gifts.

Mike felt that the admin process worked well for them.

## Structure

## Skeleton

## Wireframes

- Both Shanti and I went through a number of wireframes to see how the site could be designed to her liking.

- The paper wireframe below was done as a way to map out to see how the web page would look like and it was a rough sketch for the next lot of wireframes.

- As Shanti is an artist we found that using paper sketches and using Balsamiq helped with the design of the wireframes.

- In the wireframe below we considered implementing the following:

- Main heading Bubba The Supershop For Dog Products

- The search bar.

- A shopping bag.

- Social media links.

The aim was to have these implemented consistently throughout the website so that the user would be able to access any of the functions.

## SEO Reflection, Research and Implementation

Market research

On the 22nd of August I conducted some market research with Shanti.  Shanti is a lover of animals amd has a pet dog amd I asked her if she was shopping on the internet what products would she like to buy for her pet.  Shanti gave me a very comprehensive list of products that she would look for. We imagined how Shanti would shop on line and what products would appeal to her and how the process of shopping online would make her feel.

Accessories would include glow in the dark collars, rope leads, harnesses, muzels, pet bowls. 

Grooming and bathing accessories would include nail clippers, pet toothpaste and brush, grooming brushes, conditioner, dog shampoo, 

clothing raincoats, winter coats, 


SEO Reflections

This reflective process was very important in the research of this project and website as it enabled one to take into consideration the needs of the users and discussing this with Shanti enabled one to clearly understand the needs of a dog owner and what they would would need and expect from an e-commerce website for dog lovers.  Originally the idea was to include many pet products for various types of pets but it became evident through Shanti's imput of focusing on dog products that we  would be aiming for a specific dog product market.

Plan out which marketing types you think would work best for your chosen business. Jot down which ones you think the business would benefit from using, and why.

Questions to ask yourself

Who are your users?

- My users are dog lovers who want to purchase dog products.

Which online platforms would you find lots of your users?

- The online platforms where I would find lots of users would be facebook, youtube, instagram, tiktok and twitter.

Would your users use social media? If yes, which platforms do you think you would find them on?

- Yes my users would use social media and the platforms that I would find them on are facebook, youtube, instagram, tiktok and twitter.

What do your users need? Could you meet that need with useful content? If yes, how could you best deliver that content to them?

- My users need information about dog products.

- I could meet that need with useful content about the products and a review for each product. I would also find the testimonials useful for delivering that content.

Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?

- At the moment the business would look into running sales and  discounts and this would need to be looked into once we were better established.

What are the goals of your business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?

- The marketing strategies that were considered for the Pawpals site were:

- Search Engine Optimization.

- Content marketing and Social Media marketing,

- I decided to rule out email marketing and paid advertising, as this was a start up and we wanted to focus on the social marketing as a way to promote the products on various platforms.


Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low cost options to market itself?

- As this is a start up E-Commerce site there would not be a budget for advertising therefore it would need to work with free and low cost options to market itself.


The article below considered the social customer demographic for purchasing dog products online.

 "In the pet food and supplies segment, social media had the biggest purchase influence on Generation Z and Millennials. In a survey conducted in October 2021 in the United Kingdom, 26 percent of Millennials reported being influenced by social media when purchasing pet food and supplies. In contrast, that figure stood at only two percent for Baby Boomers."

- We considered the content marketing process as quite useful as the website was giving an emotional response to friends that saw the website. Shanti also had very good 
  experience of owning a dog and it was her insight into dog care that was both inspirational and interesting.  Shanti could empathise with fellow dog lovers and knew that good products were important to dog lovers.

- Shanti was interested in the organic social media marketing as she used these platforms to connect with family, friends, colleagues and the community.  These platforms would 
  be useful for Shanti to sell her Dog Products.

- As Shanti also has an existing blog for pets the supershop for dogs Pawpals, would be considered as an extension of how good quality dog products could be sold to potential  
  customers.

- Shanti also dog sits and walks dogs for friends and again it was this social aspect of her involvement with dogs and animals that promoted the idea of having the supershop 
  for dogs promoted on the organic social media marketing contents.

- Both Shanti and I discussed the idea of email marketing and paid marketing and Shanti felt that she did not want to come across as forceful in selling her products but  
  wanted the customers to trust the website and the products being sold naturally.

Content marketing

The content if this website aims to invoke an emotional response with customers that are passionate about dogs. The content has been created specifiaclly for dog lovers and only products for dogs are being sold on this site.  It was decided that a generic site for a variety of pets may take the focus away from dogs. The idea was for dog lovers to view products that they needed for their dog of dogs. Shanti is a dog lover and she has a dog and she also house sits for other dog owners and walks dogs in her spare time her passion for dogs has enabled her to gain knowledge and understand about the needs of dogs and this has made her an expert in this field. Shanti showed an interest in sharing her love for animals by having a blog post created for her interest where she could share her interest and interact with other animal lovers.

Social Media marketing

Shanti already has a blog post for animal lovers so as to spread her passion about animals and caring for them.  Shanti wants to also promote her e-commerce site and products on social media and specifically Facebook.  Shanti realised that this was a good method to create awareness about animal welfare and also promote her e-commerce site.


## Web Marketing  

Creating a Facebook Business Page was shown by the code institute.  The Facebook page is up and running.

I have put the rel="noopener" in the code for the social media links for facebook as it is an external website and this was suggested to be good practise from code institute.


Newsletter

The newsletter was created on mailchimp and the process was shown by the code institute.


[MailChimp success message on site for subscribing](media/mailchimpsuccess.png)

I have put the rel="noopener" in the code for the social media links for mailchimp as it is an external website and this was suggested to be good practise from code institute.


The meta tags were added for meta description and the meta keywords in the base.html file as shown by the code institute.

## Clarification about rel attributes

My mentor asked me to check with tutor support what rel attributes I should use for my external links and they confirmed that rel="noopener" was correct and to ensure that I had target="_blank".

Hi tutors my mentor asked me to double check with my project I have a facebook link and a mail chimp link and need to know what I put in the rel attribute.

When defining the relationship between the current document and a linked document, ensure the following:
Use “nofollow” for any paid links and distrusted content.
Use “sponsored” for any sponsored or compensated links.

ok so its up to you what you put in there - heres some info on norefer and nopen
What rel=”noreferrer” Does and How to Remove It (searchfacts.com)
Thanks Alan that is really helpful is it ok to just keep the noopener in the rel attribute for both and do I need a target=blank also
Alan profile
target blank will open a new tag / window so given that you are going to an external site, i would thing that that target blanks would be suitable here, we would only use target blank on external sites
Great I will keep the target blank and keep the rel=noopener.
Have a great day Alan and thank you for all of your help you are a star mate 🌟
Alan profile
You are welcome, and best of luck with your project, hope you have a fab day

## Bug report

Squashed bugs
On 16 June 2022 found that shopping bag icon was not working and checked code and found was at the end of code on line 82 of base.html and once this was removedd the icon did work.

On the 27th of September whislt doing a test on the deployed Heroku site for the login I noticed that there was a 500 error and on further investigation had to fix string casting bug in models.py in profiles app.

Remaining bugs

Resolved Issues

On the 21st of August I had to contact tutor support whether the dj_database_url and psycopg2-binary installations would be compatabile versions for the project.  The tutor support informed me that having the incorrect versions may cause errors amd guided me innstalling the correct versions into my requirements.txt file with the migrate command.

Whilst checking the shopping bag checkout we found a bug in signals.py that was giving us an error whilst we were trying to make a transaction.  We fixed it by putting in the code below.

@receiver(post_save, sender=OrderLineItem)
def update_on_save(sender, instance, created, **__kwargs):
    """
    Update order total on lineitem update/create
    """
    instance.order.update_total()

The following resources helped us to sort out the bug.

[Git push Issues](media/gitpushissues.png)


## Security

My tutor Mike informed me that it was not good practise in the coding industry to generate secret keys from unknown websites on the internet and that it was best to generate a secret key in the terminal with the command python3 -c.  

We had to remove all target="_blank" except MailChimp because it breaks the back button in the web browser, which is considered bad user interface design:
Source: https://www.digital.ink/blog/website-links-new-tab/

My tutor Mike informed me this was bad practise for both User Iterface design and a security issue.


## Testing 

[Testing](TESTING.md)

## Deployment

The project was created in gitpod.  


I committed the code to Git and used the terminal to push to Github.  The next step was to remotely deploy to Heroku.


 Heroku Deployment 


- I created an Heroku app

- I clicked  "Create new app" in Heroku.

- Created a new app name 

- Then I selected Europe as the location. 





The Postgres database was attached:

I then went to te resources tab and under add-ons typed in Postgres amd selected the Postgres Heroku option.



Then I had to prepare the environment and settings.py file:



I clicked on the Settings tab:

 - I clicked  on Reveal Config Vars/ 
 
 - Then next to DATABASE_URL I copied the URL.

- I went to the  GitPod workspace and  created an env.py file in the main directory.

- In the env file I: 

  - Added  the DATABASE_URL value. 

  - and added the chosen SECRET_KEY value. 


in Heroku I added  the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars.


I updated the settings.py file so as to import the env file.
I added  the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.


I added the following to the  settings.py:

- STATIC_URL

- STATICFILES_DIRS

- MEDIA_URL

- MEDIA_ROOT

- TEMPLATES_DIR

- Update the DIRS in TEMPLATES with the TEMPLATES_DIR

- Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']

- Set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and Deploy to Heroku:

There were three directories created in the main directory; 

- media, storage and templates.

Then I created a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
- web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi

Deployment via Heroku

in the terminal, log in to Heroku and then enter the following:

heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app (Heroku App Name)

I went to the 'Deploy' tab on Heroku and connect to GitHub, then to the required repository. 

I then clicked on 'Deploy Branch' and wait for the build to load. 

I waited for the build to complete, then I opened the app through Heroku for deployment.


There were some issues with deploying to Heroku and the tutors informed that this was a common version update issue and sent me some more information to follow so as to get the website deployed properly.

The tutors informed that this was because of the versions in python and Heroku and I would have to set up a compatable version. 

Please click below about how the issues with Heroku deployment were resolved.

[Heroku Issues](Issuesheroku.md)


The steps I had to take were.

- Create an runtime.txt and add python-3.9.14

Then add the following in the terminal:

1. touch runtime.txt && echo "python-3.10.7" > runtime.txt
2. git add . && git commit -m "Add runtime.txt for heroku deployment"
3. git push origin main
4. git push heroku main

Deployment

[Deployment Issues 2 continued](media/deploymentissues2.png)

[Deployment Issues 3 continued](media/deployissues3.png)

[Deployment Issues 4 continued](media/deployissues4.png)


My mentor informed me that there was no need to clone or fork the project.  He explained what these did and said that the deployment was the most important thing to do.

Cloning Project with Github

Forking Project Via Github


The tutors showed me how to the apply the public mode.


Hi tutors I have been checking the check list for my project 5 and it says to get GitHub project board set to public visibility.I was not sure how to do this
