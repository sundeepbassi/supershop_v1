Project Overview

Introduction
The Supershop for doggy things was inpired by a petblog that was created for a friend Shanti.  Shantis devotion and care for animal welfare and her pet dog amazed me and after doing the petblog we thought about how Shantis experience in purchasing products for her pet dog were the next step in showing her dedication to animal welfare.  Shanti had a welfare of experience in pet care and when we first discussed this e-commerce website Shanti was able to give an extensive list of products that could be considered for selling.
It was Shanti's experience in owning a dog for the first time that made us realise that there will be people who will be considering the idea of owning a dog for the first or who already have a dog and want to be able to purchase dog products with ease and support.

We considered the social customer demographic for this E-Commerce site.

- People who are new to dog owning and this is their first pet.

- Existing dog owners

- People interested in rescuing dogs from shelters.

- People who foster dogs.

- People of various ages.

- People that have a passion for dogs.

SEO Reflection, Research and Implementation

SEO Reflections

This reflective process was very important in the research of this project and website as it enabled one to take into consideration the needs of the users and discussing this with Shanti enabled one to clearly understand the needs of a dog owner and what they would would need and expect from an E-Cpmmerce website for dog lovers.  Originally the idea was to include many pet products for various types of pets but it became evident through Shanti's imput of focusing on dog products would be aiming for a specific market.

Keywords Challenge
In our last video, we walked through a basic process for keyword research. In this unit we’re going to challenge you to use that same process to plan some possible keywords for a project of your own.

Your challenge is to walk through these steps we went through in the previous video. Come up with a selection of keywords you think would be important to customers for your chosen business.

Choose a business idea to do your keyword research for.

Dog products 

Your own project idea (possibly for your final project)

The idea was to create an E-Commerce website for dog products.

Keyword research steps

Brainstorm your general topics

On the 22nd of August I conducted some market research with Shanti who is the inspiration for this E-Commerce website as it was her passion for dogs and animals that was amazing.  Shanti is a lover of animals amd has a pet dog amd I asked her if she was shopping on the internet what products would she like to buy for her pet.  Shanti gave me a very comprehensive list of products that she would look for. We imagined how Shanti would shop on line and what products would appeal to her and how the process of shopping online would make her feel.

Accessories would include glow in the dark collars, rope leads, harnesses, muzels, pet bowls. 

Grooming and bathing accessories would include nail clippers, pet toothpaste and brush, grooming brushes, conditioner, dog shampoo, 

clothing raincoats, winter coats, 


Brain dump possible keywords for each of the general topics

The brain dump of ideas shortlisted 3 possible general ideas with subcategories.

Dog Accesssories would include the following:

- Collars

- Harnesses

- Leads

- Toys

Dog Clothes would include the following:

- Jackets

- Scarves/Bandanas

- Fancy Dress

Dog Food would include the following:

- Tinned 

- Biscuits

- Nutrition

Research your brain dump of ideas in Google Search

The general topics have been listed below with the highest ranking this also took into consideration what potential customers will be looking for to purchase.

Ensure you have a selection of short and long-tail keywords

Short-tail keywords

- Dog Products

[Google search for Dog Products 1](media/dp12022-09-06%20(1).png)

[Google search for Dog Products 2](media/dp22022-09-06%20(2).png)

[Google search for Dog Products 3](media/dp32022-09-06%20(3).png)




- Dog Collars

[Google search for Dog Collars 2 ](media/dc22022-09-06%20(5).png)


- Dog Harnesses

- Dog Leads

- Dog Jackets

- Dog Scarves/Bandanas

- Dog Fancy Dress

- Dog Food



Long-tail Keywords

- The best nutrition for dogs?

[Google search for The best nutrition for dogs? 1](media/bnfdgs12022-09-06%20(7).png)

[Google search for The best nutrition for dogs? 2](media/tbnfdgs22022-09-06%20(8).png)



- What tinned foods do dogs like?

- What are the best bicuits to give you dog?

- What toys do dogs like to play with?



Assess your choices for relevance and authoritativeness, and dig into the data available on keyword volume and competition using wordtracker.com

I found that dog products was a good keyword for relevance and authoritativeness.

The dog products keyword was inputted into wordtracker.com and the results can be seen below in the screenshots.

[Google search for the keyword dog products 1](media/wt12022-09-06%20(9).png)

[Google search for the keyword dog products 2](media/wt22022-09-06%20(10).png)

[Google search for the keyword dog products 3](media/wt32022-09-06%20(11).png)


From this list I revised the keywords from the brain storm and brain dump and incorporated the following keywords for the project,

dogfood

dog collars

dog harness

dog toys

best dog foods

dog clothes






Tips


Document your process.
If you’re planning for your final project, keep this documentation for your README
By the end of this exercise you should have between 10 and 20 keywords, which should be a mix of short-tail keywords and long-tail phrases.

Note
Keyword research is not an exact science. The volume and popularity of keywords constantly shifts. This means that deciding on keywords for a project is just the beginning of a journey, and marketing departments for e-commerce businesses have to continuously analyse and adjust them.



Content Challenge
 Bookmark this page
Content Challenge
In our last video, we talked about what things to consider including in your web page content to ensure it’s deemed a high quality search result.

In this unit we’re going to challenge you to use what you have learned and plan a single web page of your own.

Using the web application idea you chose for the keywords challenge, either:
Your own project idea (possibly for your final project)
A pizza restaurant, based in Dublin, that takes online orders for delivery.
Choose one important page from your chosen application. This might be the home page, a single product or service page or another important page in the application. Choose a page that you hope users would first land on when visiting your website.

Questions to ask yourself:
What do your users need?
What information and features can you provide to meet those needs?
How can you make the information easy to understand?
How can you demonstrate expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness in your content?
Would there be other pages within your own site you could link to from your chosen page?
Are there opportunities to link back to external websites that already rank highly on Google?
How can you help users discover other relevant parts of your web application?
Tips
Research other sites that already meet the needs your users have, find examples of how they accomplish that.
Use the keyword list you created in the Keyword challenge to help prompt further ideas
Document your process. If you’re planning for your final project, keep this documentation for your README.
Give yourself around 10 to 15 mins to work on this.

By the end of this exercise you should have a list of things to include on your chosen web page that will be valuable to your user, and therefore improve its search engine ranking. Remember, if you’re using this exercise to plan for your final project, keep this documentation for your README.

Welcome sundeepbassi,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

------

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

------

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

---

Happy coding!

On the 22nd of August I conducted some market research with some friends.  Shanti is a lover of animals amd has a pet dog amd I asked her if she was shopping on the internet what products would she like to buy for her pet.  Shanti gave me a very comprehensive list of products that she would look for. We imagined how Shanti would shop on line and what products would appeal to her and how the process of shopping online would make her feel.

Accessories would include glow in the dark collars, rope leads, harnesses, muzels, pet bowls. 

Grooming and bathing accessories would include nail clippers, pet toothpaste and brush, grooming brushes, conditioner, dog shampoo,

Marketing Types Challenge
In our last videos, we explained some of the pros and cons of each marketing type, and we talked about which businesses they suit.

In this unit we’re going to challenge you to use what you have learned and plan which marketing types to use for an ecommerce business.

Using the ecommerce business idea you chose for the keywords and content challenges:
Your own project idea (possibly for your final project)
A pizza restaurant, based in Dublin, that takes online orders for delivery.
Plan out which marketing types you think would work best for your chosen business. Jot down which ones you think the business would benefit from using, and why.

Questions to ask yourself
Who are your users?

Content marketing

The content if this website aims to invoke an emotional response with customers that are passionate about dogs. The content has been created specifiaclly for dog lovers and only products for dogs are being sold on this site.  It was decided that a generic site for a variety of pets may take the focus away from dogs. The idea was for dog lovers to view products that they needed for their dog of dogs. Shanti is a dog lover and she has a dog and she also house sits for other dog owners and walks dogs in her spare time her passion for dogs has enabled her to gain knowledge and understand about the needs of dogs and this has made her an expert in this field. Shanti showed an interest in sharing her love for animals by having a blog post created for her interest where she could share her interest and interact with other animal lovers.

Social Media marketing

Shanti already has a blog post for animal lovers so as to spread her passion about animals and caring for them.  Shanti wants to also promote her e-commerce site and products on social media and specifically Facebook.  Shanti realised that this was a good method to create awareness about animal welfare and also promote her e-commerce site.

Resolved Issues

On the 21st of August I had to contact tutor support whether the dj_database_url and psycopg2-binary installations would be compatabile versions for the project.  The tutor support informed me that having the incorrect versions may cause errors amd guided me innstalling the correct versions into my requirements.txt file with the migrate command.

Welcome sundeepbassi,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
