# Project Overview

During this project I was unfortunately made homeless and it was the kindness of my family and friends and my Doctor and the student support team at the code institute that gave me the support that I needed to get through.  I learnt alot from this process and I was determined that I would not give up and carry on with the project to the best of my ability.

## Introduction

Bubba the Supershop for dog products was inpired by a petblog that was created for a friend Shanti.  Shantis devotion and care for animal welfare and her pet dog amazed me and after doing the petblog we thought about how Shantis experience in purchasing products for her pet dog were the next step in sharing her experience of caring about her pet dog.  Shanti had a wealth of experience in pet care and when we first discussed this e-commerce website Shanti was able to give an extensive list of products that could be considered for selling.

It was Shanti's experience in owning a dog for the first time that made us realise that there will be people who will be considering the idea of owning a dog for the first time or who already have a dog and want to be able to purchase dog products from someone who has good experince in dog ownership.

In her own words Shanti said 

"life is better with a dog"




## Evolving The name of the company to Pawpals 

## Pawpals

During the design and implementation process of this project, Shanti decided that she would like to call the company PawPals a dog's best friend.  The logo of the Paw inspired Mike and Shanti to have an emotional response of how dog's were best friends of humans and the Pawpals would be the best friends for dogs. This process happened during a design meeting with Shanti and Mike in their kitchen and both of them felt very inspired to rename the title of the company with its motto.  They felt the love for dogs gave them an insight into what would be appealing on this website for dog lovers.

After considering this idea for Pawpals I checked on the internet to see if the name was already in use, and we found that it was being used.

[Search for Pawpals on the web ](https://pawpalsshop.com/)

Shanti and Mike still liked the name pawpals and wanted to keep it whilst developing the site and were happy to reconsider changing it if they wanted to make the site an official company so as not to break any copyright infringements.




What I like about this project is that the ideas are being produced organically and Shanti and Mike have shown what is important to be a dog owner and what fellow dog owners may expect from an e-commerce website. 

The aim is to:

- To promote good dog and animal welfare.

- To grow a sense of community for dog lovers.

- To allow good quality products to be sold.


## E-commerce application types:

We considered the social customer demographic for this E-Commerce site.

Who is the customer?

- The business to customer model was identified as the best for this e-commerce site.
 
 - Dog product customers tend to be impulse buyers.

 - These customers make up their own choices about what to buy for their dogs.

 - They prefer a simple and effective method of payment, so as to buy impulsively.


- People who are new to dog owning and this is their first pet.

- Existing dog owners

- People interested in rescuing dogs from shelters.

- People who foster dogs.

- People of various ages.

- People that have a passion for dogs.

What will they buy?

- They will buy products for their dog/s.

- Dog Accessories
 - collars
 - Harnesseses
 - Leads
 - Toys

- Dog Food
 - Tinned
 - Biscuits
 - Nutrition

- Dog Clothes
 - Jackets
 - Scarves/Bandanas
 - Fancy Dress

How will they pay?

- As customers they will be buying products and the method used will be a single payment system. As the transaction is finished once the customer has made the single payment for the products.

- They will pay online on the site through Stripe.

- The Supershop for dog products is a business to customer B2C website as products will be on sale for individuals to purchase for their dogs.

What is being sold? Deliverables

- Dog Products will be sold to customers with product details. As there will be a name for each product, a price of that product, an image of that product, a description of that particular and a product for the customer to see.

How is the payment made?

- The payment will be made as a single payment as the customer is paying for products that are displayed on the website. This will not be a subscription payment site.

With the Code Institute module on E-commerce Applicationn types and the article by BigCommerce, we decided that the business to customer model was right for this company to develop and grow on the web.

## Project Future

- To continue to promote  the site for dog lovers and animal welfare.

- As this is a shop for dog lovers and we want to create a sense of community about dog ownership posting pictures of pet dogs by customers on a board would be good.

Future Features

In the future we would like to let each registered user be able to submit only one review.

I discussed incorporating the user story from below with my mentor and it we decided that this could be used for a future feature or I could use the method I had incorporated with the email confirmation for registering an account.  I decided because of time constraints I would do this as a future feature.

As a shopper I want to be able  to  receive an email confirmation after checking out so that I can keep the confirmation of what I have purchased for my records.

I also showed my mentor the information from stripe that email confirmations for payment receipts are not sent for test transactions.

## Develpoment Planes

We wanted a website that would appeal to dog lovers by products for their dogs and any related audience who had an interest in animal welfare. Shanti and Mike were the main inspirations for this site. They both gave me an insight as potential users about what the user stories could be or this site.  As dog lovers they gave me a wealth of knowledge about what dog products could be sold on the site.  I also checked out the following sites for further information.

[Whilst I was designing the site I came acress this online store that inspired me ](https://www.petshop.co.uk/)

[Search for Pawpals on the web ](https://pawpalsshop.com/)

[Pet Planet](https://www.petplanet.co.uk/d2/dog_products)

These sites gave me an idea about how the layout could be worked out for Pawpals and check on how the functionality worked on the sites and what features could work best.

## Strategy

- This was quite a unique site because both Mike and Shanti could both be site users and site owners.  Therefore their perspective was very relevant in developing the site.

- Both Mike and Shanti came from creative backgrounds and wanted the site to be as appealing as possible.

- Shanti is an artist and a teacher and her knowledge in art and colour matching would help the site to be more attractive.

- Both Mike and Shanti had a clear vision that the target audience aimed at for this site should be anyone who loves dogs.  

- The focus was for it to be for dog owners or potential new dog lovers.

- Any Age group could use this site.

- Their experience with owning a dog had helped them to connect with other dog owners.

- They had taken their dog to cafe nero a dog friendly cafe and they met other like minded dog owners.

  - Taking care of their dogs.

  - Talking about their experiences about their dogs.

  - Sharing funny or memorable stories about their dogs.

  - Talking about their dogs habits or behaviour.

  - Sharing information about dog products and dog gifts.

## Structure

## Skeleton

## Wireframes

- Both Shanti and I went through a number of wireframes to see how the site could be designed to her liking.

- The paper wireframe below was done as a way to map out to see how the web page would look like and it was a rough sketch for the next lot of wireframes.

- As Shanti is an artist we found that using paper sketches and using Balsamiq helped with the design of the wireframes.

- In the wireframe below we considered implementing the following:

- Main heading Bubba The Supershop For Dog Products

- The search bar.

- A shopping bag.

- Social media links.

The aim was to have these implemented consistently throughout the website so that the user would be able to access any of the functions.

## SEO Reflection, Research and Implementation

Market research

On the 22nd of August I conducted some market research with Shanti.  Shanti is a lover of animals amd has a pet dog amd I asked her if she was shopping on the internet what products would she like to buy for her pet.  Shanti gave me a very comprehensive list of products that she would look for. We imagined how Shanti would shop on line and what products would appeal to her and how the process of shopping online would make her feel.

Accessories would include glow in the dark collars, rope leads, harnesses, muzels, pet bowls. 

Grooming and bathing accessories would include nail clippers, pet toothpaste and brush, grooming brushes, conditioner, dog shampoo, 

clothing raincoats, winter coats, 


SEO Reflections

This reflective process was very important in the research of this project and website as it enabled one to take into consideration the needs of the users and discussing this with Shanti enabled one to clearly understand the needs of a dog owner and what they would would need and expect from an e-commerce website for dog lovers.  Originally the idea was to include many pet products for various types of pets but it became evident through Shanti's imput of focusing on dog products that we  would be aiming for a specific dog product market.

- My users are dog lovers who want to purchase dog products.

Which online platforms would you find lots of your users?

- The online platforms where I would find lots of users would be facebook, youtube, instagram, tiktok and twitter.

Would your users use social media? If yes, which platforms do you think you would find them on?

- Yes my users would use social media and the platforms that I would find them on are facebook, youtube, instagram, tiktok and twitter.

What do your users need? Could you meet that need with useful content? If yes, how could you best deliver that content to them?

- My users need information about dog products.

- I could meet that need with useful content about the products and a review for each product. I would also find the testimonials useful for delivering that content.

Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?

- At the moment the business would look into running sales and  discounts and this would need to be looked into once we were better established.

What are the goals of your business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?

- The marketing strategies that were considered for the Pawpals site were:

- Search Engine Optimization.

- Content marketing and Social Media marketing,

- I decided to rule out email marketing and paid advertising, as this was a start up and we wanted to focus on the social marketing as a way to promote the products on various platforms.


Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low cost options to market itself?

- As this is a start up E-Commerce site there would not be a budget for advertising therefore it would need to work with free and low cost options to market itself.


The article below considered the social customer demographic for purchasing dog products online.

 "In the pet food and supplies segment, social media had the biggest purchase influence on Generation Z and Millennials. In a survey conducted in October 2021 in the United Kingdom, 26 percent of Millennials reported being influenced by social media when purchasing pet food and supplies. In contrast, that figure stood at only two percent for Baby Boomers."

- We considered the content marketing process as quite useful as the website was giving an emotional response to friends that saw the website. Shanti also had very good 
  experience of owning a dog and it was her insight into dog care that was both inspirational and interesting.  Shanti could empathise with fellow dog lovers and knew that good products were important to dog lovers.

- Shanti was interested in the organic social media marketing as she used these platforms to connect with family, friends, colleagues and the community.  These platforms would 
  be useful for Shanti to sell her Dog Products.

- As Shanti also has an existing blog for pets the supershop for dogs Pawpals, would be considered as an extension of how good quality dog products could be sold to potential  
  customers.

- Shanti also dog sits and walks dogs for friends and again it was this social aspect of her involvement with dogs and animals that promoted the idea of having the supershop 
  for dogs promoted on the organic social media marketing contents.

- Both Shanti and I discussed the idea of email marketing and paid marketing and Shanti felt that she did not want to come across as forceful in selling her products but  
  wanted the customers to trust the website and the products being sold naturally.

Content marketing

The content if this website aims to invoke an emotional response with customers that are passionate about dogs. The content has been created specifiaclly for dog lovers and only products for dogs are being sold on this site.  It was decided that a generic site for a variety of pets may take the focus away from dogs. The idea was for dog lovers to view products that they needed for their dog of dogs. Shanti is a dog lover and she has a dog and she also house sits for other dog owners and walks dogs in her spare time her passion for dogs has enabled her to gain knowledge and understand about the needs of dogs and this has made her an expert in this field. Shanti showed an interest in sharing her love for animals by having a blog post created for her interest where she could share her interest and interact with other animal lovers.

Social Media marketing

Shanti already has a blog post for animal lovers so as to spread her passion about animals and caring for them.  Shanti wants to also promote her e-commerce site and products on social media and specifically Facebook.  Shanti realised that this was a good method to create awareness about animal welfare and also promote her e-commerce site.


## Web Marketing

I have put the rel="noopener" in the code for the social media links for facebook as it is an external website and this was suggested to be good practise from code institute.


Newsletter

The newsletter was created on mailchimp and the process was shown by the code institute.

I have put the rel="noopener" in the code for the social media links for mailchimp as it is an external website and this was suggested to be good practise from code institute.


The meta tags were added for meta description and the meta keywords in the base.html file as shown by the code institute.

## Clarification about rel attributes

My mentor asked me to check with tutor support what rel attributes I should use for my external links and they confirmed that rel="noopener" was correct and to ensure that I had target="_blank".

Hi tutors my mentor asked me to double check with my project I have a facebook link and a mail chimp link and need to know what I put in the rel attribute.

When defining the relationship between the current document and a linked document, ensure the following:
Use “nofollow” for any paid links and distrusted content.
Use “sponsored” for any sponsored or compensated links.

ok so its up to you what you put in there - heres some info on norefer and nopen
What rel=”noreferrer” Does and How to Remove It (searchfacts.com)
Thanks Alan that is really helpful is it ok to just keep the noopener in the rel attribute for both and do I need a target=blank also
Alan profile
target blank will open a new tag / window so given that you are going to an external site, i would thing that that target blanks would be suitable here, we would only use target blank on external sites
Great I will keep the target blank and keep the rel=noopener.
Have a great day Alan and thank you for all of your help you are a star mate 🌟
Alan profile
You are welcome, and best of luck with your project, hope you have a fab day

## Bug report

Squashed bugs
On 16 June 2022 found that shopping bag icon was not working and checked code and found was at the end of code on line 82 of base.html and once this was removedd the icon did work.

On the 27th of September whislt doing a test on the deployed Heroku site for the login I noticed that there was a 500 error and on further investigation had to fix string casting bug in models.py in profiles app.

Remaining bugs

Resolved Issues

On the 21st of August I had to contact tutor support whether the dj_database_url and psycopg2-binary installations would be compatabile versions for the project.  The tutor support informed me that having the incorrect versions may cause errors amd guided me innstalling the correct versions into my requirements.txt file with the migrate command.

Whilst checking the shopping bag checkout we found a bug in signals.py that was giving us an error whilst we were trying to make a transaction.  We fixed it by putting in the code below.

@receiver(post_save, sender=OrderLineItem)
def update_on_save(sender, instance, created, **__kwargs):
    """
    Update order total on lineitem update/create
    """
    instance.order.update_total()

The following resources helped us to sort out the bug.

[Git push Issues](media/gitpushissues.png)


## Security

My tutor Mike informed me that it was not good practise in the coding industry to generate secret keys from unknown websites on the internet and that it was best to generate a secret key in the terminal with the command python3 -c.  

We had to remove all target="_blank" except MailChimp because it breaks the back button in the web browser, which is considered bad user interface design:
Source: https://www.digital.ink/blog/website-links-new-tab/

My tutor Mike informed me this was bad practise for both User Iterface design and a security issue.


## Testing 

[Testing](TESTING.md)

## Deployment

The project was created in gitpod.  


I committed the code to Git and used the terminal to push to Github.  The next step was to remotely deploy to Heroku.


 Heroku Deployment 


- I created an Heroku app

- I clicked  "Create new app" in Heroku.

- Created a new app name 

- Then I selected Europe as the location. 





The Postgres database was attached:

I then went to te resources tab and under add-ons typed in Postgres amd selected the Postgres Heroku option.



Then I had to prepare the environment and settings.py file:



I clicked on the Settings tab:

 - I clicked  on Reveal Config Vars/ 
 
 - Then next to DATABASE_URL I copied the URL.

- I went to the  GitPod workspace and  created an env.py file in the main directory.

- In the env file I: 

  - Added  the DATABASE_URL value. 

  - and added the chosen SECRET_KEY value. 


in Heroku I added  the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars.


I updated the settings.py file so as to import the env file.
I added  the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.


I added the following to the  settings.py:

- STATIC_URL

- STATICFILES_DIRS

- MEDIA_URL

- MEDIA_ROOT

- TEMPLATES_DIR

- Update the DIRS in TEMPLATES with the TEMPLATES_DIR

- Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']

- Set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and Deploy to Heroku:

There were three directories created in the main directory; 

- media, storage and templates.

Then I created a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
- web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi

Deployment via Heroku

in the terminal, log in to Heroku and then enter the following:

heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app (Heroku App Name)

I went to the 'Deploy' tab on Heroku and connect to GitHub, then to the required repository. 

I then clicked on 'Deploy Branch' and wait for the build to load. 

I waited for the build to complete, then I opened the app through Heroku for deployment.


There were some issues with deploying to Heroku and the tutors informed that this was a common version update issue and sent me some more information to follow so as to get the website deployed properly.

The tutors informed that this was because of the versions in python and Heroku and I would have to set up a compatable version. 

Please click below about how the issues with Heroku deployment were resolved.

[Heroku Issues](Issuesheroku.md)


The steps I had to take were.

- Create an runtime.txt and add python-3.9.14

Then add the following in the terminal:

1. touch runtime.txt && echo "python-3.10.7" > runtime.txt
2. git add . && git commit -m "Add runtime.txt for heroku deployment"
3. git push origin main
4. git push heroku main

Deployment

[Deployment Issues 2 continued](media/deploymentissues2.png)

[Deployment Issues 3 continued](media/deployissues3.png)

[Deployment Issues 4 continued](media/deployissues4.png)


My mentor informed me that there was no need to clone or fork the project.  He explained what these did and said that the deployment was the most important thing to do.

Cloning Project with Github

Forking Project Via Github


The tutors showed me how to the apply the public mode.


Hi tutors I have been checking the check list for my project 5 and it says to get GitHub project board set to public visibility.I was not sure how to do this

## Custom 404 error page

[Custom 404 error page](media/custompage.png)


I had originally submitted my project 5 on the 23rd of November and I had informed student care I would be on a retreat to recover from the stress I had during 2022.  I returned from my retreat on the 18th of January 2023 and it was highlighted in the emails from the code institute that the link to my project was not working and that this was not classed as a fail if done within 48 hours. However as I was on retreat I received this email during the time in my retreat and I did not have access to emails or social media.  I was informed to resubmit the project and the code instiute kindly gave me till the 20th of February to submit my project 5.  

Whilst reworking on the project 5 I was informed by Heroky that my postgres database had been deleted.  

I got in touch with the tutors and they gave me the process to follow to migrate the data to elephant sql.  

One of the tutors Gemma was excellent in showing my how to reinstall my original database and I am forever grateful for her kind dedication, professional skills and the high quality standard of tutoring from Gemma.

The contact below shows how the postgres database was reinstalled safely.

Hi Tutors,
I followed the steps that Jason kindly gave me to put me elephantsql DATABASE_URL into my env.py file and my heroku config vars. Because I submitted my project 5 on the 23rd of November my postgres database was deleted by Heroku. I did a python3 manage.py runserver and I am getting this page without my data that I originally installed. I am also getting an error in my heroku app. I am not sure what I should do any help would be much appreciated.

Gemma profile
Hi Sunny, Gemma here 👋, hope you're doing well this evening :)
So when you say the project is submitted, do you have permission to make any alterations currently?
Hi Gemma, the assessment team sent me an email early Jan stating it was not a fail and I needed to get the link to work for it to be assessed. Because I was in a retreat after submitting my project 5 on the 23rd of Nov I got the email last week and they said I would need to resubmit my project for assessment and they gave me til the 20th of Feb
Thank you for your kind support I hope you are well too
My originalproject was working good but heroku deleted my postgres database
Gemma profile
Ok, gotcha - that's good to know 👍
So have you run tail logs to see what's happening in Heroku?
In the gitpod terminal, connect to heroku:
heroku login -i
then once logged in:
heroku logs --tail -a your_app_name
🙂
Thanks Gemma I will give it a go
Gemma profile
let me know the response you get - this will give us clues as to what's going on there :)
Gemma profile
Any luck there, Sunny? :)

I am not sure if I entered it correctly

I think I forgot to add the dash

still getting that error
Gemma profile
Ok, and does your app have those underscores on it in heroku?
No I dont thoink I put any underscores on it in Heroku

just gave me those errors when I tried to run the app
Gemma profile
Ok great, that's exactly what we need to look at 👍
Thank you Gemma
Gemma profile
So that error H14 that we see there, is usually due to dynos not being able to run - did you also set up the EcoDynos on Heroku?
I followed the weinair from jo c and harry I can send you a screenshot of my dynos
Gemma profile
That'd be great, thank you :)

Gemma profile
Ok, thanks - could you please click on the resources tab?

Gemma profile
ok, can you try flipping this switch?:


do I also press confirm button
Gemma profile
let's just do this differently incase, back in the terminal, can you type:
heroku ps:scale web=1

Gemma profile
Great - now check your app url and see if it's up and running 👍
ok in Heroku?
Gemma profile
yes, that's right - my side, currently, I can see it up, but it looks like it's still missing the products - we can work on that next 👍

Gemma you saved my life it works
that is what it originally looked like
Gemma profile
brilliant 🎉, but I think we still need to get those products showing - have you tried clicking on the products?
Thank you Gemma you are a brilliant tutor
I will give it a go
Gemma profile
Thanks, Sunny, much appreciated! 😊

I clicked the products and they are not showing
Gemma profile
Ok, so back to the database, then which variables do you have set up in the Heroku app, please?
ok I ill send a screenshot
Gemma profile
👍

Gemma profile
Ok, can you check for this one, does the url match what you have in Elephant, please?:


Gemma profile
Also, when you first submitted the project, did you definitely have products in the database?
I added it yesterday when Jason kindly showed me what to do I set up the elephant sql yesterday the one in my env.py is with brackets and the one in heroku is without brackets
Hi Gemma When I first submitted the project there products with photos an descriptions and prices and my mentor went through it with me to make sure it all worked correctly
Gemma profile
Ok, good to know, thanks for confirming, and do you have an admin login so we can test adding a product in the admin? I'm just thinking if you reinstalled the DB but the other one had been deleted, your products might have gone with it and need re-adding
yes I do have admin, do i go to the address bar at the top and add /admin to open up the admin
Gemma profile
That's it 👍

Hi Gemma I tried opening the admin and it did not open
Gemma profile
You might want to create a new superuser so that you can login if the old user is not working 🙂
I remenmber Ed helped me to set up the superuser for it
ok great do I type in superuser into the gipod terminal
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
Then do a hard reload on the deployed site itself
CTRL-SHIFT-R on a PC, or CMD-SHIFT-R on a Mac
And use the login credentials in the /admin panel 🙂
Gemma profile
(make sure you are still logged into heroku in gitpod too :)
if not you can heroku login -i again
ok I will give it a go

Gemma profile
ok great, and now the new superuser 👍
I did the heroku login into my gitpod terminal as you kindly showed me
Gemma profile
great, so now we need this:
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
Then do a hard reload on the deployed site itself
CTRL-SHIFT-R on a PC, or CMD-SHIFT-R on a Mac

Thanks Gemma it took a bit of time becasue I a;ways write it down i my notebook
Gemma profile
no problem at all - written notes are handy!
So if you can try and login to your admin there, and see if you are able to add a product :)
ok I will give it a go
Gemma profile
fab, let me know how you get on 🙂
Hi Gemma I tried to do the hard reload onto the deployed site but it will not open the admin panel
Gemma profile
it's showing this side, try this url:
https://supershop-2022.herokuapp.com/admin

Thank you it is working now
Gemma profile
brilliant - have you been able to add a product?

Hi Gemma, thank you yes I have been able to add a product image not showing though
I can try to work on it
Would it be best to add my procts like this as I did before for my databse

Thank you Gemma I got the image to work this time
Gemma profile
Great job :)
Yes you can either add them manually, or if you have a fixture (a file that has all your products in it, you could upload this using the following command:
python3 manage.py loaddata myfile.json
🙂
Great Gemma I am very grateful for eveerything you have done and really saved this project, Oisin helped me to set up the json file before in my gitpod would reuse that one ?

That was the one that was in my gitpod terminal
Gemma profile
Ah brilliant that Oisin got that set up :) yes you can use that one 👍
Brilliant I will do the command and see if it works
Gemma profile
Good luck, Sunny 🤞

Thanks Gemma I got those messages, if you are tired I can carry on working with it on Sunday
I am aware that you have given me a lot of your kind time to sort it out and you may also need a break, You have really helped me to make a lot of progress
Please let your managers know from that your dedication and excellent skills as a tutor are truly priceless
Please let your managers know from me that your dedication and excellent skills as a tutor are truly priceless
Gemma profile
No problem, Sunny - I'm still good to help, sorry if there is a delay in between. 🙂
Ah ok, I can see the issue there - Because you already have users in your db, so you can either delete the items from the sheet that are causing the issue (whole objects, rather than just lines) or delete them from the admin first, then your file should go in :)
Brilliant Gemma I will give it a go
Gemma profile
👍 let me know how you get on 🙂

I got those messges
I deleted the products and categories I added earlier in my admin
Gemma profile
How about the user with the ID of 2 - which user is that?
Sorry Gemma I had to go to the bathrrom, I will have a look now
Gemma profile
No worries :)
Hi Gemma I remember having set up,an original superuser and Ed kindly helped me to update it as the first one caused issues
Ok, did you want me to take a look this side?
Gemma profile
I could log into your admin and see which data is crossing over?
Please that would be great
I went through the profiles files
do you need my username and password
Gemma profile
Ok, great stuff - yes please for the username and pw 👍
username is sunnylife
and password is karmarpa888
Gemma profile
👍
Gemma profile
Do you mind if I give it a try uploading from this side?
You only seem to have the one user in there which is the superuser, so in theory it should go through ok..
please do
Gemma profile
Just to confirm, it's the new.json, is that correct?
yes I think that is the one Oisin did
Gemma profile
👍
Gemma sorry I realsied just now looking at my files bar there are two other db.json files and I cannot remember which he used
I know he had problems trying to upload and he had to do it from his end to get iit to work
Shall I see if I still have the original chatbox message from him
Gemma profile
Ok, that would be great - it doesn't seem to want to go in 🙂

I am doing the boutique ado Creating a Heroku App and on the top of the video there is this message. Important!
Error fix
If you get the error below during the steps to deployment:
django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL: role "somerandomletters" does not exist
Please run the following command in the terminal to fix it:
unset PGHOSTADDR
A note for creating your database if you didn't use fixtures
When you come to follow this process for your milestone project, you may not have used a fixtures file to populate your database like the instructor did.
If this is the case, manually re-creating your database when you come to deploy can take a considerable amount of time. Thankfully, there is a short process you can follow to download your local mysql database and then upload it to postgres:
Make sure your settings.py file is connected to your sqlite3 database
Use this command to backup your current database and load it into a db.json file:
./manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
Connect your settings.py file to your postgres database
Then use this command to load your data from the db.json file into postgres:
./manage.py loaddata db.json
Your database DATABASE_URL on supershop-2022 requires maintenance. During this period, your database will become read-only. Once maintenance has completed, your database credentials and hostname will have changed, but we will update your app's config variables accordingly to reflect the new database connection string.
This automated maintenance is a necessary part of our Hobby tier plans, Dev and Basic. Should you need more control over maintenance windows, a production database (Standard tier or higher) offers more control over database maintenance, as we are able to schedule them in advance and provide better tools for self-served maintenance.
We expect maintenance to last just a few moments depending on the size of your database. We will notify you when maintenance begins, and again once it's complete.

Hi Sunny, John here
I hope you are well
Looks like an email from Heroku about database maintenance
John profile
There's nothing wrong. Heroku need to run maintenance on their servers from time to time.
All that will happen is, your database credentials will rotate.
What this means is that your database will have a new Postgres URI (DATABASE_URL)
Hi John good to hear from you hope you are well
Thank you, I am well :)
Your heroku app config vars will update automatically
John profile
You'll simply need to update your local DATABASE_URL with the new Postgres URI

Hi John I added the new link from Heroku
I added my products manually into my admin django and I tried to follow the dev tips on slack and was getting confused with it
John profile
You will fail the project if you push the code to the repo with this line exposed in settings.py
SORRY jOHN i DID NOT UNDERSTAND DO i UNCOMMENT IT
sorry my caps lock was on
would it be best to uncomment lines 133 to 138
John profile
That line there is your postgres URI string. It should be hidden, and never pushed to the Repo. But this is covered in the course materials.
Even there in the PDF that you are walking through, it is using the DATABASE_URL variable
I remember when I watched the video they told us to comment it out and then they put it back in
what would the best thing to do
John profile
They told you to comment it out for a short while, then they stored the variable in DATABASE_URL and used that instead, so that the variable would not be exposed.
Do you have an env.py file in your project?
I have had a look and I can not find one
John profile
Alright, so you should probably set that up.
For setting env vars locally, we recommend setting them like this:
Create a file named env.py in the root directory of your project. This is the file you will use to define your environment variables.
If you don't have one already, create a file named .gitignore in the root directory of your project.
Next we need to stop git from pushing this file to github, and so keep your environment variables secret. To do this, open your .gitignore file add the following text to it: env.py
At the top of your env.py file, you need to import os so that you can set the environment variables in the operating system. Once you have added the line “import os” underneath you can assign your environment variables using the following syntax:
os.environ["Variable Name Here"] = "Value of Variable Goes Here"
Example: os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "ohsosecret"
Then the following code imports this new env.py file where you need to use your environment variables. For example your app.py file for flask project or settings.py file for Django project. Add this under your other imports at the top of the file.
import os
if os.path.exists("env.py"):
import env
The if statement here is so that the env.py file is only pulled when working on your code in your workspace, not when it is deployed on heroku. For deployment you can set your environment variables in the heroku dashboard in settings > config vars.
Now that your environment variables have been set in your env.py file, and the file has been imported into your project, you can use them as needed using the following syntax:
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
﻿Make sure you save all your files before testing if it works.
how do i set up the env.py in the root directory
I have a gitignore file
sorry john it is confusing
i created my env.py file there
I put that info into the env.py file
John profile
Okay, follow the steps to declare your variables.
Hi john i am still confused wit the steps
John profile
Hey Sunny, unfortunately you need to follow the steps, step by step. Exactly as they are laid out there.
Your on the right path, but you need to put in your actual variables.
In this case DATABASE_URL, and then you need paste the value of the postgres URI where the value of the variable goes
os.environ["Variable Name Here"] = "Value of Variable Goes Here"
Example: os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "ohsosecret"
Then the following code imports this new env.py file where you need to use your environment variables. For example your app.py file for flask project or settings.py file for Django project. Add this under your other imports at the top of the file.
import os
if os.path.exists("env.py"):
import env
The if statement here is so that the env.py file is only pulled when working on your code in your workspace, not when it is deployed on heroku. For deployment you can set your environment variables in the heroku dashboard in settings > config vars.
Now that your environment variables have been set in your env.py file, and the file has been imported into your project, you can use them as needed using the following syntax:
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
﻿Make sure you save all your files before testing if it works.
I have managed to do that

This part is meant to be in settings.py
John profile
take it out of env.py and place it in settings.py, here's the instruction :)

I added it to settings file
John profile
Excellent, now go back to the DATABASES code in your settings.py and make sure it looks like this
Thanks John I will work on that and will get bgck to you once it is done, I appreciate your kindness and support it takes me time to understand the steps
John profile
You're welcome Sunny.
I'm actually due for my break now, but I'll set this conversation aside and leave notes for my fellow tutors.
You can simply reply to re-activate it and someone will be with you as soon as available
Thanks John have a good break 😄
John profile
Thanks Sunny 😀
Hi I have added the new line of coded in my settings,py file from line 138 to line 148 do I take out the oldcode from line 131 to 136
Ed profile
Hi Sunny, Ed here 👋
Hope you're well. Sorry for the delay we've got a few tutors off sick today. How are you getting on with John's suggestion?
Hi Ed good to hear from you, I am good thank you How are you doing, sorry to hear that some of the tutors are off sicj
I managed to do that Ed
Ed profile
I'm good thanks! Hopefully they will all be on the mend soon - it's the season for getting poorly!
I know I cannot believe we are in september
Ed profile
OK, so you shouldn't need the first DATABASES = .... part
You can remove lines 131-136
great
I managed to do that Ed
Ed profile
I'm just trying to load up your workspace, but from John's last message it sounds like you were trying to create an env.py to get your local server up and running. Are you now able to load your app through Gitpod?
https://sundeepbass-supershopv1-6tuyxyxoq9v.ws-eu64.gitpod.io/
John helped me to set up the env.py file
Ed profile
Awesome, and has that allowed you to load your site?
I am not sure on how to load it Ed the extra bank holiday has made my brain run slower
Haha, they'll do that :)
Just the regular old python3 manage.py runserver should get you going :)
Ed profile
Looking at your env.py, there will be a couple more environment variables you need to add. The most obviously missing one is SECRET_KEY
that was the message I got when I tried to open my server
Ed profile
OK, that means you need to apply your migrations. Just follow the advice it gives 👍
sorry Ed how do i set up a secret key in env.py
Ed profile
You already have one written in your settings.py, so you'll need to change that so that it's pointing to os.environ['SECRET_KEY']
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', '')
Then in your env.py:
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'my_superseCRETkey1497149014091470'
or whatever you want it to be :)
Thanks I will give it a go
Ed profile
You don't want to expose your secret key in your settings.py like this. Replace with what I posted above. That means it will get your SECRET_KEY from your environment, which is env.py in this case. In Heroku it will be your Heroku config vars.
Ed profile
Have another check of what I put in my last message Sunny:
one change in settings.py
one addition in env.py
thanks ed
i will have another go
Ed profile
👍
We make a variable in settings.py which points to the environment using the dictionary key 'SECRET_KEY'
We then make an entry in env.py using that dict key and give it the secret value.
If you're wanting to make use of these other environment variables in your LOCAL project, then you'll need to do the same thing. See how these three variables are set to the values it finds in your environment:
That will mean you need dictionary entries, and their values, for STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY AND STRIPE_WH_SECRET too.
Ed profile
In settings.py:
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', '')
This means, make a variable called 'SECRET_KEY' and get the value from the environment (env.py). If you can't find 'SECRET_KEY' in the environment, use a blank string.
In env.py:
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "some_secret_string"
This is what the SECRET_KEY variable in settings.py is pointing to. In effect, in settings.py your app will see:
SECRET_KEY = 'some_secret_string'
Except 'some_secret_string' is coming from a hidden file that only your app can see. This means noone else in the world can see your secret key.
The same applies to all secret things you want to do - just stick them in your environment and refer to the value found for that dictionary item.
Thanks Ed I will give it a go
Ed profile
OK fab! I need to head to lunch, Sunny so will pop you back in the queue for the next tutor to pick up with.
If you can let them know where you get to that would be very helpful. From what I can see your app is working locally, but you will need to understand what role the env.py (environment) is playing so that you can add any necessary keys here, and when you come to deploy your app. In your Heroku app, the 'Heroku config vars' act as your local environment, rather than env.py, so you'll need to make sure all the required keys and values are stored there too 👍
Thank you Ed for all of your kind support Have a good lunch buddy
Ed profile
Great, will do. You too Sunny! 👋
👍

Hi I followed the steps shown by Ed wanted to check if they are correct
Oisin profile
Hi Sunny, Oisin here 👋
﻿Yep that looks good. Just having a look through the chat now. What was the specific issue that you wanted to address in this conversation?
Hi oisin good to hear from you hope you are well I am trying start off the deployment process for Heroku and I have been following the devtips sheet from slack and I could not uderstand it and both John and Ed were helping me
I added my products manually in the Django Admin and we were told to follow a certain format for this
Oisin profile
Ok perfect, which part of the deployment process were you having trouble with?
https://code-institute-room.slack.com/files/UPDFEU62U/F02SZ5T16HG/transferring_database_data_from_sqlite_to_heroku_postgres.pdf?origin_team=T0L30B202&origin_channel=C01C4AU8ULA
I was working on that sheet and found it difficult to follow
Important!
Error fix
If you get the error below during the steps to deployment:
django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL: role "somerandomletters" does not exist
Please run the following command in the terminal to fix it:
unset PGHOSTADDR
A note for creating your database if you didn't use fixtures
When you come to follow this process for your milestone project, you may not have used a fixtures file to populate your database like the instructor did.
If this is the case, manually re-creating your database when you come to deploy can take a considerable amount of time. Thankfully, there is a short process you can follow to download your local mysql database and then upload it to postgres:
Make sure your settings.py file is connected to your sqlite3 database
Use this command to backup your current database and load it into a db.json file:
./manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
Connect your settings.py file to your postgres database
Then use this command to load your data from the db.json file into postgres:
./manage.py loaddata db.json
If you would like more information on this process along with a few handy tips, have a look at this DevTip on Slack.
That is the informaiton they gave us at the start of the video
Oisin profile
Ok, if you run your server in gitpod now, are your products there?
they are not displaying
it wont let me log into my admin now
Oisin profile
Ok, so your products are stored in the sqlite database. Do you want to transfer them to the heroku postgres database?
I added my products to django admin manually
Yes I think I have to transfer to the heroku postgres database
Oisin profile
Ok, you will need to comment out the DATABASE_URL variable in your env.py, so that your settings will use the sqlite database which contains your products.

is that what i do
Oisin profile
Ok perfect, make sure to save the file, then run your server to confirm that the products are there.
Hi Oisin the products are there
Oisin profile
Ok perfect now we're going to run this command to save your data to a json file:
﻿Make sure to type the command instead of copy/paste
python3 manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
i will have a go
Hi oisin I typed it in like that is tha tok
Yep that's perfect, you can hit enter
Oisin profile
That will create a db.json file containing your data
it gave me an error
I think there was a space before the second 'exclude'
Oisin profile
You can use the up arrow to go to a previous command and remove the space, then hit enter
ok
Make sure to remove the space before the second exclude
You can use the right and left arrows to move the cursor in the terminal
Oisin profile

Oisin profile
Make sure to type the command exactly as it is here:
﻿

is that correct Oisin
Oisin profile
Ok perfect, now you can uncomment the DATABASE_URL in your env.py, then save the file
I did that
Oisin profile
Ok now lets load the data into your postgres database:
﻿
python3 manage.py loaddata db.json
2:25 pm
Oisin profile
I'm not sure if the previous commands ran correctly, do you mind if I try running them again?
Please oisin that will be good
do you want me to put them in the terminal
Oisin profile
I've run them so lets run your server now to confirm if the data has been transferred to your postgres database
do i do python3 manage.py runserver
yep exactly 🙂
Oisin profile
Looks like the products haven't been transferred, I'm going to try to transfer only data from specific apps ok?
thanklyou
Oisin profile
Ok, looks like that has transferred successfully 🙂
thankyou Oisin you are a star
Oisin profile
Glad to help! 🙂 Now you can continue with the rest of the deployment steps as outlined in the course materials.
Thank you Oisin I will follow the video now you have been a great help have a great day

I found that in the original conversation with oisin I thin he used the db json file
Gemma profile
Ok, great, I'll try that one 👍
Sorry Gemma for all this trouble
Gemma profile
No problem at all - I'm thinking we delete the superuser - we can always add another, the second file is also not working - can you try it from your side first incase it's logging me out of the heroku db?
ok so I create a superuser like before
Gemma profile
not yet, if you can:
heroku login -i
then load the data with the db that Oisin made you :)
ok I will give it a go
Gemma profile
👍 if that doesn't work, we'll delete the superuser and try again :)
Do I use the command that Oisin gave me with that file as he asked me to write it in and not copy as sometimes that does not work
Gemma profile
no, use the command I gave - Oisin's one will extract a copy of your data, and mine uploads it :)
python3 manage.py loaddata db.json
thanks
I will give it a go
Gemma profile
Perfect, let me know how you get on :)

shal we create a new superuser
Gemma profile
Not yet, I'll delete your current superuser, then try to upload without that there, then we can create a new superuser 👍
thankyou
Gemma profile
ok, all good to try the upload again - exact same process:
python3 manage.py loaddata db.json

Gemma profile
and you were logged into heroku in the terminal?
yes i did log in I can try it again to make sure
Gemma profile
It's worth a shot, It seems like it's connecting to your local db, but it's odd because you have the database url in your env.py - is that the up to date one?

I tried it again
Gemma profile
How many products do you have on there?
Iput the new in yesterday from elephant bsql and the old one i commented out below it
I caanot remember to be precise I think 12 x 10 for each category 120 products
I am wondering if it is because debug is set to false
Gemma profile
I think I've found the culprit in the file - I'm just copying across in a formatted version so that all the profile and admin log entries can be removed
Brilliant Gemma
Gemma profile
Ok, now try this:
python3 manage.py loaddata db3.json
This is for the categories and products only, so then you can create users after - does that sound ok?
brilliant I will give it a go
Gemma profile
🤞
Sorry do you need me to login again with the login command for heroku in my terminal
just to be on the safe side, that'd be great
Gemma profile
Looks like it's working! :


your a star gemma
Gemma I am crying with Joy you really saved my life and my project
Gemma profile
Woohoo, I'm so glad that's working for you, Sunny!
You can go ahead and create a new superuser now and you should be all set - perhaps create a few reviews with the new users 👍
Yes I will do this and Gemma your dedication and help has been outstanding
Thank you
You can also now delete those old db files that were no longer working to tidy things up:

9:00 pm
Gemma profile
It's a pleasure, Sunny! Best of luck with getting that submitted! 😊
Yes great Idea I am very happy
Gemma profile
Are you good to go now, shall I get this closed off for you, as I'm also heading off now too :)
A big thank you and yes please have a great break and a wonderful weekend
do I delete the old superuser
when I create the new one
You won't need to delete anything, just create a new one 👍
Gemma profile
Have a lovely weekend, Sunny! 😊👋

Jason profile
Hi Sunny, Jason here. Do you have the Gitpod extension installed in your Browser?
am not sure jason
good to hear from you
To the right of the address bar should be an icon that looks like a jigsaw piece.
﻿
﻿
﻿If you can click that, following by Manage Extensions at the bottom of the window.

Jason profile
If you have the extension installed, you should see it listed:
﻿
﻿


sorry jason can not locate the jigsaw icon

Jason profile
Instead, can you select the 3 dots in the top right of the screen, please?
﻿
﻿

thanks I followed that and got this screen

Jason profile
In which case, you do not have the browser extension installed - It can be found here.
﻿
﻿It is worth mentioning that the reel2reel process will not work if you are looking to migrate your Heroku Database, as these were deleted on November 28th, 2022.
Thank you for letting me know Jason, I submitted my project on the 25th of November and it was not migrated then,. What would the best thing to do ?
Jason profile
If you did not migrate your Heroku database before it was removed, you will need to link your project to your Elephant SQL database and complete migrations.
﻿
﻿Once this is done you will need to populate your database with any required information (Products etc), in the same way you would have done before you submitted your project.
﻿
﻿Unfortunately, there isn't any way to recover any information from the old Heroku database.
I managed to add the extension Jason thank you
Thanks Jason, I have set up the elephant sql do I just get the database url from there and add it to my env.py file

Jason profile
Yeah. You'll need to add it to your env.py file in Gitpod to be able to complete your migrations etc.
﻿
﻿You'll also need to remember to change your DATABASE_URL config var in the Heroku Dashboard.
Thank you you are a star Jason, I think I get it know I replace the old database_url with the one from elephantsql and also and that to the heroku config vars and create a new databse_url in that and to run the migration I have to do them in the terminal but I can not remember the migrations command
Jason profile
To create your migration files the command is:
﻿
﻿python3 manage.py makemigrations
﻿
﻿You shouldn't need to do this though, as you will have done this before you deployed your project.
﻿
﻿It's worth double checking by adding the --dry-run flag to the end of the command. This will show you if there are any migrations to be made, but won't actually make any changes. The command in full would be:
﻿
﻿python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run
﻿
﻿Assuming there are no other changes to be made, you can migrate your changes to the database with:
﻿
﻿python3 manage.py migrate
﻿
﻿Or, if you want to see the changes before they are made:
﻿
﻿python3 manage.py migrate --plan
Jason you are a brilliant I have put the databse_url from elephant sql in my env.py file I think it needs to be in brackets, I have also put it in the Heroku config vars do I need that one in brackets also?

Jason profile
What do you mean, sorry?

in my env.py file the old datebase_url was in brackets I have commented it out below the datbase url and I noticed the one from elephantsql was not in any brackets " " . I was wondering I should stick to the same rule of keeping thee new database_url code in brackets
and would I alos have to put the elephantsq;l I copied into the heroku config vars would that also need to be in brackets?

I did the dry run migration and I got that in my terminal
Can you share your Gitpod workspace, please?
Jason profile
To share your Gitpod Workspace:
Click on "Share" in the left bottom corner of your workspace;

It will update to "Shared by" followed by your username:

Then, copy the workspace url in this chat for us to be able to see your code.

https://sundeepbass-supershopv1-6tuyxyxoq9v.ws-eu84.gitpod.io/
Jason profile
I'm not sure what you've changed, but it seems to be working now?
I realised that I did not save it when I made the changes in the env.py file and after saving it seemed to be ok
Jason profile
Ah, cool. You should be able to migrate now.

Hi tutors,
I have been trying to do the task that was set for me yesterday to get my link working for my project 5. I have been watching the webinair by jo c and harry to set up the elephant sql for my project. I noticed in my Heroku config vars that there was no DATABASE_URL.
Would I need to copy the DATABASE_URL from my env.py and put it into my config vars settings to get my database to work for my project.

Hi Sunny, Rebecca here 👋 How are you? Is this for a resubmission?
The DATABASE_URL would no longer exist in your config vars, after the removal of the postrgres database. The DATABASE_URL would be from the ElephantSQL now, so you'd need to copy this from there.
Hope that helps! 😊
Hi Rebecca good to hear from you How are You?
Hi yes this is a resubmission I am not bsure how to do this wit elephantsql
Rebecca profile
And you! I'm well, thanks for asking 😊
Have you created the database in ElephantSQL yet?
I watched the webinair and was a bit confused, is it best to watch it again and start with setting up elephant sql
Do I just replace the old databse_url with the new one from elephantsql
Rebecca profile
Oh dear! Yes, I'd recommend watching it again, just to help you understand it a bit better. And then use that that follow along to create the database in ElephantSQL.
When you have that, you will get a new url here

Where you will paste into your env.py DATABASE_URL and in Heroku as well.
I'm hoping that makes sense 😅 Let me know if you have any further questions 😊
Reebecca you have been brilliant this has helped me alot I am very grateful for your very kind support, I am ok for you to close this ticket and I will be in touch if I need any further help. Have a great day 👍

Hi tutors,
Student care and the assessment team asked me to contact the tutors because I submitted my project 5 on the 23rd of November and I will need to resubmit it because the link to my project did not open. They told me it was not classed as a fail but the assessor needed to have the link working for it to be assessed. After submitting my project on the 23rd I was away on retreat and got the messages from the student care team recently. I have also tried to check on slack. When I type python3 manage.py runserver into my terminal I am getting these error messages and on Heroku I am getting a message that my database has been deleted because the free plans have finished.

Hey Sunny, Ger here how are you?
Ger profile
I wonder is this issue due to the fact the the database has changed
hi Gr Thank you I am good how are you buddy?
Ger profile
Have you signed up for the github student pack and done all the eco dynos etc?
Yes Gir it is due to the changes in the database
I did sign up for the student pack the eco dyno I do not remember because it was in november
I remember having to submit my card details to heroku
Ger profile
Ok so you will need to do a few things
sign up to the github student pack
apply the dynos to the apps
get a elephantsql database
replace the postgress database with elephantsql
10:13 am
Is there some where I can go to do all of this and heroku said that the database would be deleted after 30 days the postgres one
Yes, you will need to have this in place. then if the database is still in tact we can try and swap out the data
Ger profile
You should of received an email from code institute outlining the steps
ok I will have a look and try to follow the steps and in my local terminal I am getting those errors when I try to open up the app locally
Ger profile
Ok what are the errors?

Ya so your database has been deleted I think, you will need to go and get elephantsql and redo all the data etc
Ger profile
There should be an email outling these steps on how to fix this
Thanks Gir I will look for the email and I will get back to you can you close the ticket as this might take me some time
Ger profile
No worries, if you are running into issues, please open a new ticket. Nice chatting with you 👋

Alan profile
Hi there, Alan here, how are you today?
Hi Alan good to hear from you I am good thanks touch wood should be submitting my project today
Alan profile
oh well done on reaching the end buddy
Thank you buddy you and allof the tutor4s have been a great help
I have to switch debug to False do I put in where it says "True" in the scrrenshot for debug
My debug was put in my env.file
Alan profile
it depends on your set up - for live heroku config vars you make sure you have no debug or dev vars in there
can you share your workspace
https://sundeepbass-supershopv1-6tuyxyxoq9v.ws-eu77.gitpod.io/

Alan profile
ok so this looks for the presence of a DEVELOPMENT var in your env - if it doesnt find it, the debug should be set to flase
But if you want to be extra careful you can set this to False directly.
Make sure your config vars doesnt have a DEVELOPMENT value in heroku
Thanks Alan I was not sure about config vars devolpoment value in heroku
Ok io meant changing it in settings.py just for the push to live so
DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
would be
DEBUG = False
Alan profile
and as i said make sure you dont have DEVELOPMENT in config var
ok I will check
Alan profile
once you have done that then your DEBUG will be False as per requirement for live

there is no development mode in heroku config vars
I set the debug to false in the env. file


Alan profile
Cool that looks good
I set the debugt to false in the settings.py is it best to do it like this
do I need "" marks around the word False
Once DEVELOPMENT is not in config vars it would be fine the other way but as i said for extra caution set it to False directly
no
Alan profile
then it would be a string
Thanks Alan for all of your kind support and advise I am very grateful fo all of yoiur support during this course yoiu are a star buddy

I have let it like this now in settings.py

The env.py is like this
You can leave that as True in the env file
Alan profile
you are welcome sunny, hope all goes well with the final submission
I reset it back to true

Thanks Alan for everything you are brilliant
ok cool so in regard to your debug all loos ok now
Alan profile
You are welocme, hope you have a fabday and good luck with the last project
Thanks Alan and wish you happiness and joy and please could you let all of the tutors know they have been brilliant and wishing everyone the best
